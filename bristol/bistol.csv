0,Randomised placebo-controlled trial of dietary glutamine supplements for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome,Gut,QiQi Zhou,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315136,"Background: More effective treatments are needed for patients with postinfectious, diarrhoea-predominant, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Accordingly, we conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week-long trial to assess the efficacy and safety of oral glutamine therapy in patients who developed IBS-D with increased intestinal permeability following an enteric infection.
Methods: Eligible adults were randomised to glutamine (5 g/t.i.d.) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was a reduction of ??0 points on the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SS). Secondary endpoints included: raw IBS-SS scores, changes in daily bowel movement frequency, stool form (Bristol Stool Scale) and intestinal permeability.
Results: Fifty-four glutamine and 52 placebo subjects completed the 8-week study. The primary endpoint occurred in 43 (79.6%) in the glutamine group and 3 (5.8%) in the placebo group (a 14-fold difference). Glutamine also reduced all secondary endpoint means: IBS-SS score at 8 weeks (301 vs 181, p<0.0001), daily bowel movement frequency (5.4 vs 2.9±1.0, p<0.0001), Bristol Stool Scale (6.5 vs 3.9, p<0.0001) and intestinal permeability (0.11 vs 0.05; p<0.0001). 'Intestinal hyperpermeability' (elevated urinary lactulose/mannitol ratios) was normalised in the glutamine but not the control group. Adverse events and rates of study-drug discontinuation were low and similar in the two groups. No serious adverse events were observed.
Conclusions: In patients with IBS-D with intestinal hyperpermeability following an enteric infection, oral dietary glutamine supplements dramatically and safely reduced all major IBS-related endpoints. Large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) should now be done to validate these findings, assess quality of life benefits and explore pharmacological mechanisms.

1,"Effect of Repeated Consumption of Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum on Fecal Characteristics and Gut Microbiota: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, and Parallel-Group Clinical Trial",Nutrients,Zenta Yasukawa,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11092170,"Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fiber and is used in solid and liquid food to regulate gut function. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of PHGG on bowel movements (stool form and frequency), plasma bile acids, quality of life, and gut microbiota of healthy volunteers with a tendency toward diarrhea, i.e., irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea (IBS-D)-like symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel trial was performed on 44 healthy volunteers (22 males, 22 females, 41.9 ± 6.3 years old (average ± SD)) with minimum 7 bowel movements every week, wherein above 50% of their stool was between the Bristol stool scale (BSS) value of 5 and 6. Intake of the PHGG for 3 months significantly improved stool form, evaluated using BSS, and had no effects on stool frequency. BSS was significantly normalized in the group consuming the PHGG compared with the placebo. Comprehensive fecal microbiome analysis by the 16S rRNA-sequence method detected significant changes in the ratio of some bacteria, such as an increase of Bifidobacterium (p < 0.05) in the PHGG group. Our results suggest that intake of PHGG improves human stool form via regulating intestinal microbiota."
2,"Stool consistency is strongly associated with gut microbiota richness and composition, enterotypes and bacterial growth rates",Gut,Doris Vandeputte,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309618,"Objective: The assessment of potentially confounding factors affecting colon microbiota composition is essential to the identification of robust microbiome based disease markers. Here, we investigate the link between gut microbiota variation and stool consistency using Bristol Stool Scale classification, which reflects faecal water content and activity, and is considered a proxy for intestinal colon transit time.
Design: Through 16S rDNA Illumina profiling of faecal samples of 53 healthy women, we evaluated associations between microbiome richness, Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, enterotypes, and genus abundance with self-reported, Bristol Stool Scale-based stool consistency. Each sample's microbiota growth potential was calculated to test whether transit time acts as a selective force on gut bacterial growth rates.
Results: Stool consistency strongly correlates with all known major microbiome markers. It is negatively correlated with species richness, positively associated to the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, and linked to Akkermansia and Methanobrevibacter abundance. Enterotypes are distinctly distributed over the BSS-scores. Based on the correlations between microbiota growth potential and stool consistency scores within both enterotypes, we hypothesise that accelerated transit contributes to colon ecosystem differentiation. While shorter transit times can be linked to increased abundance of fast growing species in Ruminococcaceae-Bacteroides samples, hinting to a washout avoidance strategy of faster replication, this trend is absent in Prevotella-enterotyped individuals. Within this enterotype adherence to host tissue therefore appears to be a more likely bacterial strategy to cope with washout.
Conclusions: The strength of the associations between stool consistency and species richness, enterotypes and community composition emphasises the crucial importance of stool consistency assessment in gut metagenome-wide association studies."
3,The Effect of Abdominal Massage on Constipation in the Elderly Residing in Rest Homes,Gastroenterol Nurs,Kıvan Çevik,https://doi.org/10.1097/sga.0000000000000343,"Constipation is a health problem commonly seen in the elderly. In the present study, the effect of abdominal massage on constipation in the elderly was examined. The study sample consisted of 22 elderly people residing in a nursing home in the province of Manisa who were suffering from constipation in June 2014 to February 2015. The following were used to collect data: a case identification form; the Rome III Functional Constipation Diagnosis Criteria Form; the Bristol Stool Scale, consisting of the Recall Bias and Visual Scale Analog; and the Standard Diary Constipation Monitoring Form. The comparison of the mean scores obtained before, during, and after the implementation of abdominal massage in the elderly revealed that the number of bowel movements, stool weight, and stool consistency scores increased during and after the implementation. The differences between the mean intra- and postimplementation scores in terms of stool weight and between the pre- and postimplementation mean scores in terms of stool consistency were not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant difference between straining scores except for those obtained during intra- and postimplementation application. It was determined that abdominal massage increased the number of bowel movements, stool weight, and stool consistency, decreased the mean scores for straining, and decreased inability to completely empty the bowels (except on the implementation days)."
4,Efficacy and Safety of Eluxadoline in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea Who Report Inadequate Symptom Control With Loperamide: RELIEF Phase 4 Study,Am J Gastroenterol,Darren M Brenner,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000327,"Objectives: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with limited effective treatment options. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide.
Methods: Three hundred forty-six adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were randomly assigned to placebo or eluxadoline 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients recorded daily IBS-D symptoms, including worst abdominal pain (WAP) and stool consistency (through Bristol Stool Scale). The primary endpoint was proportion of composite responders, defined as patients who met daily composite response criteria (??0% WAP improvement and <5 Bristol Stool Scale score) for at least 50% of treatment days, and recorded ??0 days of diary entries over the 12-week period.
Results: Over 12 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of eluxadoline patients achieved the primary composite responder endpoint compared to placebo (22.7% vs 10.3%, P = 0.002), and component endpoints of improvements in stool consistency (27.9% vs 16.7%, P = 0.01) and WAP (43.6% vs 31.0%, P = 0.02). Additionally, a greater proportion of eluxadoline patients met the composite responder endpoint assessed at monthly intervals compared to placebo (weeks 1-4: 14.0% vs 6.9%, P = 0.03; weeks 5-8: 26.7% vs 14.9%, P = 0.006; weeks 9-12: 30.8% vs 16.7%, P = 0.002). Rates of adverse events were comparable in both groups (37.4% vs 35.3%); no treatment-related serious adverse event, cases of sphincter of Oddi spasm, or pancreatitis were reported.
Discussion: Eluxadoline appears safe and effective for treating IBS-D symptoms in patients with an intact gallbladder reporting inadequate relief with prior loperamide use."
5,What to Do and What Not to Do in the Management of Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Choosing Wisely Report,Pain Ther,Domenico Alvaro,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00195-z,"Introduction: Despite the essential utility of opioids for the clinical management of pain, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) remains an important obstacle in clinical practice. In patients, OIC hinders treatment compliance and has negative effects on quality of life. From a clinician perspective, the diagnosis and management of OIC are hampered by the absence of a clear, universal diagnostic definition across disciplines and a lack of standardization in OIC treatment and assessment.
Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of physician experts who treat OIC was assembled to identify a list of ten corrective actions-five ""things to do"" and five ""things not to do""-for the diagnosis and management of OIC, utilizing the Choosing Wisely methodology.
Results: The final list of corrective actions to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of OIC emphasized a need for: (i) better physician and patient education regarding OIC; (ii) systematic use of diagnostically validated approaches to OIC diagnosis and assessment (i.e., Rome IV criteria and Bristol Stool Scale, respectively) across various medical contexts; and (iii) awareness about appropriate, evidence-based treatments for OIC including available peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs).
Conclusions: Physicians who prescribe long-term opioids should be forthcoming with patients about the possibility of OIC and be adequately versed in the most recent guideline recommendations for its management."
6,Clinical trial: the effects of a trans-galactooligosaccharide prebiotic on faecal microbiota and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,D B A Silk,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03911.x,"Background: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Aim: To investigate the efficacy of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers.
Methods: In all, 44 patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either 3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
Results: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS."
7,"Determining Risk Factors to Develop a Predictive Model of Incontinence-associated Dermatitis Among Critically Ill Patients with Fecal Incontinence: A Prospective, Quantitative Study",Wound Manag Prev,Li Wei,,"Critically ill patients with fecal incontinence are at high risk of developing incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Scientific prediction and prevention of IAD are essential.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for IAD among critically ill patients with fecal incontinence. Based on this information, a predictive risk assessment model was developed to provide research evidence for IAD prevention.
Methods: A prospective study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2017. Convenience sampling was used to recruit patients with fecal incontinence treated in intensive care units (ICUs) at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in China. Trained nurses collected demographic data (age, gender, and ICU type), data related to fecal incontinence (Perineal Assessment Tool [PAT] scores, bowel movement frequency, and stool traits per the Bristol Stool Scale), and clinical data (length of ICU hospitalization, body temperature, diabetes history, hypertension history, consciousness, nutrition support, oxygen supply, number of antibiotic species, sedative use, and albumin levels) from participants and their medical records. The PAT was used to assess patient risk of developing IAD, and the Bristol Stool Scale was used to assess patient stool traits. Names were coded anonymously, and data were entered from paper-and-pencil questionnaires into a software program for statistical analysis. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for IAD. A predictive risk factor model was established using a receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: Among 266 critically ill patients with fecal incontinence (182 male, 84 female; mean age 64.18 ± 17.10), IAD incidence was 65.4%. The use of sedative drugs, coma status, higher PAT score, more frequent bowel movements, and loose stool were found to be independent risk factors for IAD (P <.05). The subsequent risk factor predictive model had a sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 96.7%, respectively, and the agreement rate was 98.1%.
Conclusion: The identified risk factors and subsequent predictive model may contribute to timely identification and quantitative risk assessment of IAD among critically ill patients. Additional quantitative research could provide a scientific basis for the development of specific preventive interventions."
8,"Differences in gut microbiota associated with age, sex, and stool consistency in healthy Japanese subjects",J Gastroenterol,Tomohisa Takagi,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-018-1488-5,"Background: Human gut microbiota is involved in host health and disease development. Investigations of age-related and sex-related alterations in gut microbiota are limited, and the association between stool consistency and gut microbiota has not been fully investigated. We investigated gut microbiota differences related to age, sex, and stool consistency in healthy Japanese subjects.
Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-seven healthy Japanese subjects aged 20-89 years were enrolled. Fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut microbiome. We evaluated the association between stool consistency [Bristol stool scale (BSS)] and gut microbiota.
Results: Although there were significant differences in the microbial structure between males and females, the α-diversity of gut microbiota showed no difference between males and females or among age groups. There were significant increases in genera Prevotella, Megamonas, Fusobacterium, and Megasphaera and Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia in males and females, respectively. The ratio of hard stools (BSS types 1 and 2) was higher in females; the ratio of loose stools (BSS type 6) was higher in males. No younger male had BSS type 1 or type 2. Fusobacterium in males was significantly higher in the loose consistency group, and Oscillospira was significantly higher in the hard consistency group in males; Campylobacter, SMB53, and Turicibacter were significantly higher in the hard consistency group in females.
Conclusions: Several changes in gut microbiota were associated with age and sex. Stool consistency and gut microbiota associations emphasized the importance of stool consistency assessments to understand intestinal function."
9,"Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for functional constipation: a randomised, sham-controlled pilot trial",BMC Complement Altern Med,Hye-Yoon Lee,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2243-4,"Background: The prevalence of functional constipation (FC) is 3-27%, and FC has been reported to cause discomfort in daily life and various complications. The treatment for FC depends on laxatives, and thus, effective and non-toxic alternative treatments are needed.
Methods: We conducted a randomised, sham-controlled parallel-design, pilot trial. Participants with FC were randomly assigned to either the real acupuncture (RA) or sham acupuncture (SA) group. The RA consisted of eight fixed acupuncture points (bilateral ST25, ST27, BL52 and BL25) and four additional points targeted to the individual based on Traditional Korean medicine (TKM). SA consisted of shallow acupuncture insertion at 12 non-acupuncture points. Twelve sessions were provided over 4 weeks. The outcome measures were weekly defecation frequency (DF), spontaneous complete bowel movement (SCBM), Bristol stool scale (BSS) score and constipation assessment scale (CAS) score. The participants were followed for 4 weeks after the treatment.
Results: Thirty participants were enrolled (15:15). The mean DF were 5.86 ± 5.62, 5.43 ± 3.39 and 5.79 ± 3.64 in the RA group and 3.73 ± 1.62, 5.00 ± 1.77 and 5.40 ± 1.96 in the SA group at weeks 1, 5, and 9, respectively. The increases in weekly SCBMs were 2.50 ± 3.86 and 2.71 ± 4.01 with RA and 2.33 ± 2.74 and 1.93 ± 2.25 with SA at weeks 5 and 9, respectively (mean difference [MD] 0.78). The BSS scores were 0.57 ± 1.72 and 1.09 ± 1.30 with RA and 0.15 ± 1.06 and 0.14 ± 0.88 with SA at weeks 5 and 9, respectively (MD 0.95). The CAS score changes were - 3.21 ± 2.91 and - 3.50 ± 3.98 with RA and - 2.67 + ±2.82 and - 2.87 ± 2.95 with SA at weeks 5 and 9, respectively. Greater improvements were observed in subgroup analysis of participants with hard stool. The numbers of participants who developed adverse events (AEs) were equal in both groups (four in each group), and the AEs were not directly related to the intervention.
Conclusions: This clinical trial shows feasibility with minor modifications to the primary outcome measure and comparator. Acupuncture showed clinically meaningful improvements in terms of SCBMs occurring more than 3 times per week and in these improvements being maintained for 4 weeks after treatment completion. As this is a pilot trial, future studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety.

10,Bladder and bowel symptoms experienced by children with osteogenesis imperfecta,J Pediatr (Rio J),Gisele Martins,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2018.12.008,"Objective: To estimate the prevalence and presentation of bladder, bowel, and combined bladder and bowel symptoms experienced by children with osteogenesis imperfecta and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical profile of these children.
Method: A descriptive study was conducted with a convenience sample of parent-child pairs of toilet-trained children aged from 3 to 18 years. Pairs were interviewed using three tools: (1) Socio-Demographic and Clinical Questionnaire; (2) Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System; (3) Rome III Criteria along with the Bristol Stool Scale. Data were stratified by socio-demographic and clinical variables and analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results: Thirty-one parent-child pairs participated in the study; 38.7% (n=12) children reported bowel symptoms, 19.4% (n=6) reported a combination of bladder issues (such as holding maneuvers and urgency) and bowel symptoms (such as hard or painful bowel movements and large diameter stools). There were no reports of isolated bladder issues. Among the child participants, 16 (51.7%) identified as female and 20 (64.5%) were 5-14 years old. The most prevalent type of osteogenesis imperfecta was type III (n=12; 38.7%) and eight (25.8%) children reported using a wheelchair.
Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the prevalence and presentation of bladder, bowel, and combined bladder and bowel symptoms in children with osteogenesis imperfecta, offering a preliminary socio-demographic and clinical profile of these children. This research is an important step toward effective screening, detection, and access to care and treatment, especially for clinicians working with this group of very fragile patients."
11,Nutritional strategies to prevent gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy,Proc Nutr Soc,Linda J Wedlake,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0029665118000101,"Radiotherapy-induced damage to non-cancerous gastrointestinal mucosa has effects on secretory and absorptive functions and can interfere with normal gastrointestinal physiology. Nutrient absorption and digestion may be compromised. Dietary manipulation is an attractive option with sound rationale for intervention. The aim of this review was to synthesise published evidence for the use of elemental formulae, low or modified fat diets, fibre, lactose restriction and probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics to protect the bowel from gastrointestinal side effects during long-course, radical pelvic radiotherapy. Thirty original studies (recruiting n 3197 patients) were identified comprising twenty-four randomised controlled trials, four cohort studies and two comparator trials. Endpoints varied and included symptom scales (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Common Technology Criteria for Adverse Events, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) and Bristol Stool Scale. Dietary and supplement interventions were employed with many studies using a combination of interventions. Evidence from RCT was weak for elemental, low or modified fat and low-lactose interventions and modestly positive for the manipulation of fibre during radiotherapy. Evidence for probiotics as prophylactic interventional agents was more promising with a number of trials reporting positive results but strength and strains of interventions vary, as do methodologies and endpoints making it difficult to arrive at firm conclusions with several studies lacking statistical power. This consolidated review concludes that there is insufficient high-grade evidence to recommend nutritional intervention during pelvic radiotherapy. Total replacement of diet with elemental formula could be effective in severe toxicity but this is unproven. Probiotics offer promise but cannot be introduced into clinical practice without rigorous safety analysis, not least in immunocompromised patients."
12,Fecal and Urinary Incontinence Associated with Pregnancy and Childbirth,Mater Sociomed,Ahmed Hussein Subki,https://doi.org/10.5455/msm.2019.31.202-206,"Introduction: Fecal incontinence (FI) and urinary incontinence (UI) are major problems faced by women worldwide, with pregnancy and delivery representing two major risk factors for these conditions. The prevalence of FI and UI varies across studies. In our region, only a few publications have addressed this topic.
Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of FI and UI in Saudi pregnant women, their characteristics, and a specific clinical pattern that could identify patients that are at a risk for incontinence.
Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire-based crosssectional study conducted over a 3 months period in 2017, among pregnant women attending King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Results: Our study included 393 pregnant women. FI was reported by 24 patients (6.1%), and fecal urgency was reported by 30.5%. UI was reported by 84 patients (21.4 %). When patients with no UI were compared with patients with UI, the only statistically significant factor was BMI (p = 0.043). There were no statistically significant differences when comparing patients with FI versus no-FI, and fecal urgency versus no-fecal urgency. However, laceration (OR: 1.696, p = 0.036), episiotomy (OR: 1.413, p = 0.029), constipation (OR: 1.944, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR: 1.993, p = 0.022), and Bristol stool scale score (p = 0.002) were statistically significant factors for determining fecal control.
Conclusion: FI and UI are frequently associated with pregnancy and delivery, but their prevalence is underestimated. The role of the practitioner is crucial in preventing and treating these conditions, and in impeding their harmful effects on the postpregnancy quality of life of Saudi women."
13,Supporting patients in reducing postoperative constipation: fundamental nursing care - a quasi-experimental study,Scand J Caring Sci,Mette Trads,https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12513,"Background: The prevalence of constipation in the general population is 2-28%. Patients with constipation report symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, straining to defecate and general discomfort. Strategies for preventing constipation include laxatives, exercise and increased fluid and fibre intake, but life style adjustments, such as exercise, eating more fibres and drinking more fluids, were not considered a solution by older patients. Previous studies have shown that actively involving patients through individualised care and support increases patients' outcome.
Aim: To test the efficacy of a nursing intervention based on active patient involvement including individualised nursing care plans and daily dialogues for patients with hip fractures in preventing constipation after surgery.
Methods: A quasi-experimental design was applied. Inclusion criteria hip fracture needing surgery, understand Danish. Exclusion criteria dementia, gastrointestinal disease. A total of 186 patients were included and 155 completed. An admission interview including Constipation Risk Assessment Scale was undertaken. On that basis an individualised nursing care plan was made. At admission, discharge and 30 days after surgery constipation, intake of fibres and fluid were measured. The Bristol Stool Scale and Rasmussen's scale were used to measure constipation. Patients in the control group received standard care of the ward.
Results: After 30 days constipation rates for patients in the intervention group were significantly lower than for patients in the control group (p = 0.042). The fibre intakes and fluid intakes were significantly higher in the intervention group (p ??0.001). The effect of liquid intake was statistically significant (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Likewise, the effect of fibre intake was statistically significant; the odds of constipation decreased with increasing fibre intake (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8).
Conclusion: Patients with hip fractures that were actively involved in their own care in preventing constipation were significantly less constipated 30 days after surgery than control patients. Increases in fluid and fibre intakes had significant effects on reducing the risk of developing constipation."
14,Gastrointestinal and metabolic function in the MPTP-treated macaque model of Parkinson's disease,Heliyon,Anna Delamarre,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05771,"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) and metabolic function are frequently altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although enteric nervous system anatomopathological alterations have previously been reported in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkey model of PD, the resulting gastric emptying and intestinal permeability functional parameters are unknown. The current exploratory study was, thus, designed to investigate these GI functional factors and insulin resistance in the MPTP-treated monkey.
Methods: Eight rhesus macaque monkeys (4 controls and 4 MPTP-treated) received the oral acetaminophen absorption test to measure gastric emptying, the oral FITC-dextran absorption test to investigate intestinal permeability, and the intravenous glucose tolerance test to assess insulin resistance. Constipation was evaluated using the Bristol stool scale.
Results: None of the tests, acetaminophen absorption, FITC-dextran absorption or glucose tolerance, showed a difference between control and MPTP-treated monkeys. MPTP-treated monkeys did present signs of transit acceleration.
Conclusion: While the MPTP monkey model reliably displays motor and certain non-motor symptoms of PD, the current study did not demonstrate the GI symptoms associated with PD."
15,Intestinal Hyperpermeability in Gulf War Veterans With Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms,J Clin Gastroenterol,Buyi Zhang,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001135,"Background: Well over 700,000 United States military personnel participated in the Persian Gulf War in which they developed chronic health disorders of undetermined etiology. Up to 25% of Veterans had persistent and chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, which they suspected were related to their military service in the Gulf.
Aim: The overall aim of the current study was to evaluate intestinal permeability in previously deployed Gulf War Veterans who developed chronic GI symptoms during their tour in the Persian Gulf.
Methods: To accomplish this, we evaluated intestinal permeability (IP) using the urinary lactulose/mannitol test. Measurements of intestinal permeability were then correlated with mean ratings of daily abdominal pain, frequency of bowel movements, and consistency of bowel movements on the Bristol Stool Scale in all Veterans.
Results: A total of 73 veterans had documented chronic GI symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) and were included in the study. A total of 29/73 (39%) of veterans has increased IP and had a higher average daily stool frequency (P<0.05); increased liquid stools as indicated by a higher Bristol Stool Scale (P<0.01); and a higher mean M-VAS abdominal pain rating (P<0.01). Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that there was a positive correlation between increased IP and stool frequency, Bristol Stool Scale, and M-VAS abdominal pain rating.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that deployed Gulf War Veterans with persistent GI symptoms commonly have increased intestinal permeability that potentiates the severity of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and stool consistency. These new findings in our study are important as they may lead to novel diagnostic biomarkers for returning Gulf War Veterans who suffer from chronic functional gastrointestinal disorders. These advances are also important for an increasing number of veterans who are now serving in the Persian Gulf and are at a high risk of developing these chronic pain disorders."
16,Characterizing Exclusively Breastfed Infant Stool via a Novel Infant Stool Scale,JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,Jennifer Gustin,https://doi.org/10.1002/jpen.1468,"Analysis of stool has long been a diagnostic tool across a number of disease states. Currently, there are two stool scales in clinical use, the Bristol Stool Scale and the Amsterdam Infant Stool Scale. However, the existing categorizations for stool may not sufficiently cover the broad range of stool output for exclusively breastfed infants. The Bristol Stool Scale is not age specific to cover children who are not toilet trained and the Amsterdam Infant Stool Scale, though developed for children who are not toilet trained, does not sufficiently cover the wide variety of consistencies of exclusively breastfed infant stools. Through a robust understanding of exclusively breastfed infant stool characteristics, a new stool scale has been developed. It is proposed that this stool scale may better assist in observing and recording exclusively breastfed infant stool in a more accurate manner, which may aid in diagnostic capabilities."
17,[Influence of constipation on enuresis],An Pediatr (Engl Ed),Marcia Rodrciguez-Ruiz,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2020.06.016,"Introduction: Constipation has classically been considered as a risk factor of enuresis, although there are increasingly more publications that report a similar prevalence of constipation in both enuretics and non-enuretics.
Objective: To determine the influence of constipation in monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic enuresis, and to find out the prevalence of the three disorders, as well the lower urinary tract dysfunction and bladder-bowel dysfunction in the population.
Material and method: A cross-sectional observational prevalence study on a representative population sample of 5 to 9 year-old school boys and girls of Galicia, Spain. A questionnaire was completed in the schools on urinary and bowel habits, which included questions from the Paediatric Lower Urinary Tract Scoring System (PLUTSS) diagnostic questionnaire and grading of the lower urinary tract dysfunctions. The enuresis was diagnosed using the International Children's Continence Society (ICSS), and if it was also associated with diurnal symptoms, it was also classified as non-monosymptomatic enuresis. The constipation was evaluated using the Rome III criteria and the adapted Bristol stool scale.
Results: A total of 772 questionnaires were included in the study. The prevalence of constipation was 20% and that of enuresis was 9.1% (62.9% monosymptomatic enuresis and 37.1% non-monosymptomatic), with the prevalence of bladder-bowel dysfunction being 5.2%. It was observed that constipation had no influence on the presence of monosymptomatic enuresis, but it did have an influence on non-monosymptomatic enuresis and lower urinary tract dysfunctions, where it was a significant risk factor.
Conclusions: The differential diagnosis between monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic enuresis is essential in the initial evaluation of the patient with enuresis, since the therapeutic management and the characteristics of both disorders are different, with constipation only being a risk factor in cases of non-monosymptomatic enuresis."
18,Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis-associated diarrhea and response to chenodeoxycholic acid treatment,JIMD Rep,Eric P Brass,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmd2.12163,"Background: In patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), chronic diarrhea is one of the earliest and main symptoms of the disease. In the current study, we evaluated the characteristics of the diarrhea and its response to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) therapy in a cohort of Dutch CTX patients.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of medical records for 33 genetically confirmed CTX patients, and abstracted the characteristics of the diarrhea and the response to CDCA therapy (15 mg/kg/day up to 750 mg/day). The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) was used for qualitative characterization of the stool.
Results: Twenty-five patients had diarrhea documented at baseline (76%). Of these patients, 10 had diarrhea rated as 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool), and 6 had diarrhea rated as 7 (watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid) using the BSS. In 10 patients for whom data were recorded, the median stool frequency at baseline was 3 per day (range 2-6 per day). The response rate with CDCA for diarrhea resolution was 100% based on at least one post-baseline visit without diarrhea and 95% as assessed at the first post-baseline visit. In 68% of cases resolution was complete and sustained as no episodes of diarrhea were documented for follow-up periods as long as 25 years.
Conclusions: Chronic diarrhea persisting for years without spontaneous remission is a common feature of CTX at diagnosis. Chenodeoxycholic acid is an effective treatment for symptomatic relief of diarrhea in patients with CTX."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri DSM 17938 and magnesium oxide (MgO) for relieving chronic functional constipation in children.
Study design: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, and parallel-group trial was conducted in five pediatric outpatient clinics in Japan. Sixty patients who were more than six months old and under six years of age with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to Rome IV criteria were randomly divided into three groups: group A (n = 20) received L. reuteri DSM 17938 and lactose hydrate as a placebo of MgO; group B (n = 19) received L. reuteri DSM 17938 and MgO; and group C (n = 21) received a placebo of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and MgO.
Results: All three groups exhibited significant improvement in defecation frequency in the fourth week compared with the baseline condition (group A: p < 0.05; group B: p < 0.05; group C: p < 0.05). The MgO group and combination group showed a significant decrease in stool consistency, but the L. reuteri DSM 17938 group did not (group A: p = 0.079; group B: p < 0.05; group C: p < 0.05). MgO significantly suppressed the presence of the genus Dialister. Defecation frequency negatively correlated with the frequency of Clostridiales-belonging bacteria among the gut microbiome.
Conclusions: L. rueteri DSM 17938 and MgO were both effective in the management of functional constipation in young children. MgO caused an imbalance in the gastrointestinal microbiome, which was not the case in the probiotic group."
20,The effect of 'Zesy002' kiwifruit ( Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis) on gut health function: a randomised cross-over clinical trial,J Nutr Sci,Sarah L Eady,https://doi.org/10.1017/jns.2019.14,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders including constipation affect up to 14 % of the world's population. Treatment is difficult and challenging resulting in a need for alternative safe and effective therapies. The present study investigated whether daily consumption of three gold-fleshed kiwifruit could alleviate constipation and improve gastrointestinal discomfort in mildly constipated individuals with and without pain. A total of thirty-two participants were enrolled in a 16-week randomised, single-blind, crossover study. Participants received either three 'Zesy002' kiwifruit or 14·75 g Metamucil® (5 g dietary fibre/d (a positive control)) for 4 weeks each with a 4-week washout between treatments. A 2-week washout period was included at the beginning and end of the study. Daily bowel habit diaries were kept throughout the study. The primary outcome measure was differences in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM). Secondary outcome measures were bowel movement frequency and stool form as well as digestive symptoms and comfort. The number of CSBM per week was significantly greater during daily consumption of three kiwifruit compared with the baseline (6·3 v. 3·3; P < 0·05) and the Metamucil® treatment (6·3 v. 4·5; P < 0·05). Stool consistency was also improved, with kiwifruit producing softer stools and less straining (P < 0·05). Gastrointestinal discomfort was also improved compared with baseline for abdominal pain, constipation and indigestion (P < 0·05) during the kiwifruit intervention and constipation during the Metamucil® intervention (P < 0·05). This randomised controlled trial demonstrates that daily consumption of three gold-fleshed kiwifruit is associated with a significant increase of two CSBM per week and reduction in gastrointestinal discomfort in mildly constipated adults."
21,Atopic Dermatitis in Adults and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Cross-sectional Study,Indian J Dermatol,Z Gizem Kaya İslamoğlu,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijd.ijd_490_18,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting a large number of people in the world. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by relapsing eczematous lesions in a typical distribution. It was first described in 1933 but exists since antiquity.
Aim and objectives: To determine the relationship between AD and IBS.
Materials and methods: A total of 109 patients with AD and 100 healthy controls were included in the study. They were defined for diagnosis of IBS according to ROME-III diagnostic criteria. Supporting findings, Bristol stool scale, frequency of defecation and history of AD and IBS were also evaluated. AD severity was assessed using Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index.
Results: A total of 62 patients (56.9%) in the AD group and 28 patients (28%) in the control group were diagnosed with IBS (P<0.001). Supportive findings excluding abnormal stool frequency and passage of mucus were more frequent in AD patients. There was no significant relationship between disease severity according to SCORAD index and variables in AD patients.
Conclusions: This is a rather uncultivated area in the field of AD. We observed that IBS was more common in AD group. Also, supporting findings like abnormal stool form, abdominal distension, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and straining were found more frequently in AD patients. These results may indicate the association between AD and IBS. In our opinion, patients with atopic dermatitis should be questioned in terms of IBS."
22,Comparative effects of A1 versus A2 beta-casein on gastrointestinal measures: a blinded randomised cross-over pilot study,Eur J Clin Nutr,S Ho,https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2014.127,"Background/objectives: At present, there is debate about the gastrointestinal effects of A1-type beta-casein protein in cows' milk compared with the progenitor A2 type. In vitro and animal studies suggest that digestion of A1 but not A2 beta-casein affects gastrointestinal motility and inflammation through the release of beta-casomorphin-7. We aimed to evaluate differences in gastrointestinal effects in a human adult population between milk containing A1 versus A2 beta-casein.
Subjects/methods: Forty-one females and males were recruited into this double-blinded, randomised 8-week cross-over study. Participants underwent a 2-week dairy washout (rice milk replaced dairy), followed by 2 weeks of milk (750 ml/day) that contained beta-casein of either A1 or A2 type before undergoing a second washout followed by a final 2 weeks of the alternative A1 or A2 type milk.
Results: The A1 beta-casein milk led to significantly higher stool consistency values (Bristol Stool Scale) compared with the A2 beta-casein milk. There was also a significant positive association between abdominal pain and stool consistency on the A1 diet (r=0.520, P=0.001), but not the A2 diet (r=-0.13, P=0.43). The difference between these two correlations (0.52 versus -0.13) was highly significant (P<0.001). Furthermore, some individuals may be susceptible to A1 beta-casein, as evidenced by higher faecal calprotectin values and associated intolerance measures.
Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest differences in gastrointestinal responses in some adult humans consuming milk containing beta-casein of either the A1 or the A2 beta-casein type, but require confirmation in a larger study of participants with perceived intolerance to ordinary A1 beta-casein-containing milk."
23,"Therapeutic potential of an anaerobic cultured human intestinal microbiota, ACHIM, for treatment of IBS",Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol,P Benno,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2019.03.003,"By administering an anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) via upper gastrointestinal route using endoscopy we aimed to rectify intestinal dysbiosis and simultaneously achieve a treatment response in IBS patients. The study population fulfilled the Rome III IBS criteria and comprised 50 patients. During 10 days, patients recorded the irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) along with the Bristol stool scale and number of stools/day. The enrolled patients were categorized as follows: 37 with diarrhea, 5 with constipation and 8 with mixed symptoms. The treatment response showed reduction in a majority of patients, 32 of which with 50-point reduction of IBS-SSS and 21 with a 100-point IBS-SSS reduction. The percentage improvement was 36 (23-49) and 28 (18-38) for women and men respectively. Short-chain fatty acids were not changed. We consider fecal microbiota transplantation in the form of ACHIM as an option for the future therapeutic armamentarium in IBS. REGISTERED TRIAL: www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02857257."
24,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of a probiotic mixture on symptoms and inflammatory markers in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS",Neurogastroenterol Motil,K Hod,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13037,"Background: Micro-inflammation is considered an element in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was previously shown to be higher in IBS compared to healthy controls, albeit within the normal range. Since probiotics may suppress micro-inflammation in the gut, we tested if they reduce symptoms and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and fecal calprotectin (FC) in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and laboratory effects of BIO-25, a multispecies probiotic, in women with IBS-D.
Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a 2-week run-in, eligible women were assigned at random to a probiotic capsule or an indistinguishable placebo, twice daily for 8 weeks. IBS symptoms and stool consistency were rated daily by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). High-sensitivity C reactive protein was tested at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. FC was tested at baseline and 8 weeks.
Key results: One hundred and seventy-two IBS-D patients were recruited and 107 eligible patients were allocated to the intervention (n=54) or placebo (n=53) group. All symptoms improved in both groups with no significant difference between them in symptom improvement, hs-CRP or FC levels.
Conclusions & inferences: An 8-week treatment with BIO-25 improved symptoms in women with IBS-D, but was not superior to placebo. This rigorously designed and executed study supports the findings of other studies that did not demonstrate superiority of probiotics over placebo in IBS. High quality clinical studies are necessary to examine the efficacy of other specific probiotics in IBS-D patients since data are still conflicting."
25,Which factors are associated with anal incontinence after obstetric anal sphincter injury?,Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,L Speksnijder,https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.23525,"Objectives: Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) is an important factor in the etiology of anal incontinence. This study aimed to evaluate whether anal sphincter defects, levator avulsion or levator ballooning after OASI is associated with severity of anal incontinence. Furthermore, we evaluated whether other factors, as constipation or altered stool consistency are associated with symptoms of incontinence after OASI.
Methods: For this multicenter prospective observational cohort study women with OASI were invited to participate at least 3 months after primary repair. All women completed validated questionnaires including St Mark's incontinence score, Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) and Cleveland Clinic Constipation score (CCCS) and underwent 4D transperineal ultrasound for assessment of the levator ani and anal sphincter.
Results: Two hundred and twenty women were included. Median follow-up was 4 months (range 3-98 months). Univariate linear regression analysis showed an association between St Mark's incontinence score with a residual defect of external anal sphincter (EAS) (1.55 (95% CI 0.04-3.07), higher parity (0.85 (0.02-1.67), time between delivery and postnatal 4D ultrasound (-0.26 (-0.56-0), BSS (1.28 (95% CI 0.67-1.89) and CCCS (0.36 (95% CI 0.18-0.54); p < 0.001). However, multivariate linear regression only found an association between St Mark's incontinence score with BSS (1.50 (95% CI 0.90-2.11); p = < 0.001) and CCCS (0.46 (95% CI 0.29 0.63); p = < 0.001).
Conclusions: Residual defects of external sphincter, detected on 4D transperineal ultrasound, are associated with severity of anal incontinence symptoms measured using St Mark's incontinence score 4 months after OASI repair. Furthermore, several clinical factors, such as constipation and altered stool consistency, appear to influence this association and may therefore play a more important role in clinical management This article is protected by copyright.

26,Anxiety and Depression Profile Is Associated With Eating Disorders in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Front Psychiatry,Chloé Melchior,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00928,"Objective: To compare the prevalence of anxiety and depression states and eating disorders (EDs) between patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy volunteers without IBS. Methods: IBS patients according to Rome III criteria referred to our tertiary care center for therapeutic management and matched volunteers without IBS were prospectively included. EDs were screened by Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food-French version (SCOFF-F) questionnaire. IBS symptom severity (IBS symptom severity score), stool consistency (Bristol stool scale), anxiety and depression levels (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), and quality of life (validated Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index) were assessed by validated self-questionnaires. Results: IBS (228) patients and healthy volunteers (228) were included. Mean age was 42.5 ± 13.9 years with mainly women (76.7%). Among IBS patients, 25.4% had positive SCOFF-F compared to 21.1% of volunteers. IBS patients more frequently had a lower body mass index (BMI) than volunteers (p < 0.0001). IBS patients with ED had poorer quality of life and more stressful life events (p = 0.02) than IBS patients without ED. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in IBS patients with ED than in volunteers without ED, respectively (19.0% vs 1.9%, p=0.00, and 60.3% vs 19.7%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The prevalence of ED assessed with positive SCOFF-F questionnaire was not significantly different between IBS patients and healthy volunteers. The combination of IBS and ED was associated with higher levels of anxiety or depression and poorer quality of life."
27,Utility of the Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITSS) and Bristol Stool Scale in non-toilet-trained children: A large comparative study,Neurogastroenterol Motil,Carlos A Velasco-Benitez,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14015,"Background: One of the criteria for functional constipation (FC) in Rome IV criteria is the presence of hard or painful bowel movements. In adults and children, the Rome IV criteria recommend the use of the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). This scale is thought not to be appropriate for evaluation of stool consistency in young children. The Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITSS) was developed as a scale for children wearing diapers. There are no prior studies comparing BITSS with BSS in a clinical setting. Our main aim was that BITSS behaves differently than the BSS as it reflects better stool characterization by parents.
Methods: Surveys were provided to parents of participants in two cities from Colombia which included the Rome IV-validated questionnaire and stool consistency assessment using pictures for BSS and BITSS.
Key results: A total of 666 responses were obtained for non-toilet-trained children, mean age was 16.6 months. Detection for normal stools was higher using BSS (58.6%) when compared to BITSS (13.6%), and conversely was more likely to be abnormal through BITSS (86.4%) than BSS (41.4%) (p < 0.0001). BITSS (57.4%) was better than BSS (25.3%) identifying hard stools in FC (p = 0.000). For hard stools per parental classification, BITSS' definition was better than BSS (75.8% vs 44%, respectively, p = 0.000).
Conclusions: The BITSS and BSS behave differently. The BITSS seems to be more sensitive to detect hard stools and FC than BSS. More studies are needed to better define whether BITSS is appropriate to replace BSS in non-toilet-trained infants and toddlers."

Probiotics may be beneficial in managing this type of diarrhoea. The aim of this 10-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 supplementation on antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in healthy adults. Subjects were randomised to receive 1 week of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (875 mg/125 mg) once per day, plus a daily dose of 8×109 colony-forming units of a multi-strain probiotic (n 80) or placebo (n 80). The probiotic or placebo intervention was maintained for 1 week after completion of the antibiotic. Primary study outcomes of consistency and frequency of bowel movements were not significantly different between the probiotic and placebo groups. The secondary outcomes of diarrhoea-like defecations, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale scores, safety parameters and adverse events were not significantly different between the probiotic intervention and the placebo. A post hoc analysis on the duration of diarrhoea-like defecations showed that probiotic intervention reduced the length of these events by 1 full day (probiotic, 2·70 (sem 0·36) d; placebo, 3·71 (sem 0·36) d; P=0·037; effect size=0·52). In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that L. helveticus R0052 and L. rhamnosus R0011 supplementation significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea-like defecations in healthy adults receiving antibiotics."
29,Influence of bowel habits on gut-derived toxins in peritoneal dialysis patients,J Nephrol,Natalia Barros Ferreira Pereira,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-020-00819-9,"Background: Gut-derived uremic toxins have been associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Alterations in bowel habits, including constipation, seem to play an additional role in uremic toxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of bowel habits with gut-derived uremic toxins and intestinal permeability in patients on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD).
Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 58 APD patients (age 52.5 ± 15.1 years; dialysis vintage 14.1 (6.0-36.5) months). Constipation was defined according to the Rome IV criteria. Bowel habits were assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS < 3 characterized by hard consistency of stools and/or low frequency of evacuation, a surrogate of slow intestinal transit time, and BSS ??3, defining regular bowel habit). The total and free serum concentration of p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were dosed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zonulin were assessed by ELISA and D(-)-lactate by colorimetric method. Dietary intake was assessed by the 3-day food records.
Results: No differences were observed in clinical, demographic, and dietary characteristics between constipated (n = 30) and non-constipated (n = 28) groups. A trend for higher total PCS (p = 0.07) and free PCS (p = 0.06) was found in constipated patients. Patients with BSS < 3 (n = 11) exhibited significantly higher levels of total and free PCS (p < 0.01) and total IAA (p = 0.04). Conversely, No difference was found in IS levels. Except for a lower serum level of D(-)-lactate in patients with BSS < 3 (p = 0.01), zonulin and LPS levels were not different.
Conclusions: Disturbed bowel habits, mainly characterized by slow transit time, may play a role in the accumulation of uremic toxins, particularly PCS, in patients on automatized peritoneal dialysis."
30,Use of gastrografin in the management of faecal impaction in patients with severe chronic constipation: a randomized clinical trial,ANZ J Surg,Lili Gu,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14863,"Background/aim: Faecal impaction (FI) is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal tract obstruction. Gastrografin is a water-soluble radiologic contrast agent that may be orally or rectally administered, with proved therapeutic benefits in adhesive small bowel obstruction. Enemas have long been advocated as the best treatment for FI. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that enteral administration of gastrografin might be more effective than enema in FI treatment inducing intestinal obstruction.
Methods: A double-blinded, controlled and randomized trial was conducted. Participants received 100 mL of gastrografin (gastrografin group) through nasointestinal tube or enemas (enema group) once daily for six consecutive days. Successful faecal disimpaction, FI time to resolution, Bristol Stool Scale, constipation severity, symptom assessment and adverse events were evaluated.
Results: A total of 124 patients were eligible, but only 83 were enrolled to this trial (mean age: 44 ± 15.8 years). Forty-two patients received enemas, and 41 patients received gastrografin, with six dropouts in each group. Successful disimpaction was achieved with enemas (69.44%) and gastrografin (88.57%; P = 0.034), mean duration of impaction was strikingly different between the two groups (67.13 versus 31.67, respectively; P < 0.01). Constipation severity and symptom assessment were significantly reduced in the gastrografin group.
Conclusion: Gastrografin given through nasointestinal tube was more effective than enema in the treatment of FI inducing colon obstruction. Gastrografin might be taken into consideration as an effective and safe therapeutic option for FI."

Design and methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis including 43 nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients (58% men; 59.0 ± 13.5 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 21.3 ± 7.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). Bowel habit was assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS <3, characterized by hard consistency of stools and/or low frequency of evacuation and BSS ??, representing a more regular bowel habit) and by the Rome III criteria. PCS and IS (serum, free and total; urinary, total) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Dietary intake was assessed by the 3-day food records.
Results: The frequency of constipation assessed by BSS and Rome III criteria was 33% (n = 14/43) and 35% (n = 15/43), respectively. The BSS <3 exhibited higher PCS, independent of renal function and dietary protein-fiber ratio (β [95% confidence interval {CI}]: serum, total PCS = 1.54 [1.06-2.23], P = .02; serum free PCS = 1.40 [1.00-1.97], P = .05; urinary PCS = 1.78 [1.10-2.90], P < .02). According to the Rome III criteria, a tendency for a higher serum total PCS (β [95% CI]: 1.39 [0.95-2.03 μmol/L], P = .09) and a significantly higher urinary PCS (β [95% CI]: 1.80 [1.11-2.94 μmol/24 h], P = .02) was found in constipated participants. No effect of a compromised bowel habit (Rome III criteria or BSS) was found on IS.
Conclusion: Constipation may lead to production of PCS in nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients."

The purpose of this work was to describe the different clinical features of functional constipation in the general population in Cotonou and to determine the impact of diet on its occurrence.
Methods: This study was conducted from July to August 2017. Subjects were considered affected by functional constipation when criteria for Rome IV or Bristol stool scale were completed.
Results: In total, 1058 participants were enrolled: (574 men, sex-ratio 1.2; average age 29 years). The prevalence of functional constipation was 24.2% (Rome IV) and 20.4% (Bristol stool scale). Clinical manifestations were dominated by the emission of hard or fragmented stools (90.6%), pushing efforts during defecation (78.9%), and feeling of incomplete evacuation (76.2%). Dietary habits among people affected by constipation were: at breakfast, maize meal + donut/peanuts (39.1%), lunch, corn dough (38.7%), at dinner, corn dough (57.4%), and as a snack banana (35.5%). There was no statistically significant relationship between constipation and morning meal (p=0.09), lunch meal (p=0.901), snack (p=0.09) or dinner (p=0.75) respectively.
Conclusion: The emission of hard or fragmented stools was the most common clinical manifestation among people affected by constipation living in Cotonou. Dietary habits do not influence the occurrence of functional constipation in our case series."
33,The effect of a multispecies probiotic on microbiota composition in a clinical trial of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome,Neurogastroenterol Motil,Keren Hod,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13456,"Background: Although probiotics are increasingly used in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), their mechanism of action has not been elucidated sufficiently. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multispecies probiotic on enteric microbiota composition in women with diarrhea-predominant-IBS (IBS-D) and to determine whether these effects are associated with changes in IBS symptoms or inflammatory markers.
Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Rome III IBS-D women completed a two-week run-in period and eligible women were assigned at random to a probiotic capsule (BIO-25) or an indistinguishable placebo, twice daily for 8 weeks. IBS symptoms and stool consistency were rated daily by visual analogue scales and the Bristol stool scale. High sensitivity C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin and microbial composition were tested at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. Microbial sequencing of the 16S rRNA was performed and data were analyzed to compare patients who responded to treatment with those who did not.
Key results: 172 IBS-D patients were recruited and 107 eligible patients were allocated to the intervention (n = 54) or placebo (n = 53) group. Compared to placebo, BIO-25 did not result in changes in microbial diversity or taxa proportions, except for higher relative proportions of Lactobacillus in the BIO-25 group (P = 0.002). Symptomatic responders to BIO-25 showed a reduction in the proportion of Bilophila(P = 0.003) posttreatment. Patients with beneficial inflammatory-marker changes had higher baseline proportions of Faecalibacterium(P = 0.03), Leuconostoc (P = 0.03), and Odoribacter (P = 0.05) compared to corresponding non-responders.
Conclusions & inferences: Identifying patients with a more amenable microbiome at treatment initiation may result in better treatment response."
34,[Update of the Rome IIII( criteria for functional constipation],Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,Ting Yu,,"The Rome IIII( criteria were released in May 2016. Based on the development of brain-intestinal axis theory, intestinal microecology, pharmacogenomics and social psychology, the Rome IIII( criteria revise the definition, diagnostic criteria, clinical evaluation process, and treatments of functional constipation (FC). The revisions are as follows: (1) Definition: FC and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome are considered to be on a continuum rather than as independent entities. (2) Diagnostic criteria: the Bristol stool scale type 1, type 2 and spontaneous bowel movements are added in the diagnostic criteria, respectively, refining the criteria for stool consistency and frequency. (3) Clinical evaluation process: the Rome IIII( criteria specifies the clinical assessment procedure for FC. The aim is to exclude organic disease, to detect the structural changes of the combination, to determine the type of guidance therapy, and to reduce unnecessary checks to improve diagnostic efficiency. (4) Pathophysiologic mechanism: much more newly investigated mechanisms are added, including the risk factors, genetics, inadequate colonic propulsion and defecation disorder. (5) Treatment: the treatment regimen summarizes the evidence-based medical evidence of new drugs, such as secretagogues and bile acid transport inhibitors, and evaluates the safety of all the new and old drugs. Compared to the Rome III( standard, the diagnosis of FC will be more stringent and efficient, and the treatment options will be more standardized and reasonable with the Rome IIII(."

Methods: This randomized, open-label, crossover study included 315 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 18-70 years treated with oral antidiabetics, with HbA1c 6.5-9.0% and BMI 18-40 kg/m2. Assessments included levels of FE-1 and blood biomarkers of nutrition, and Bristol Stool Scale and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores. Plasma exposure of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) after oral administration of free omega-3 carboxylic acids or ethyl esters with breakfast was investigated in patients with low, intermediate, and normal FE-1 levels.
Results: The prevalence of low and intermediate FE-1 levels was 5.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Bristol Stool Scale scores and mean values of GSRS Diarrhoea and Indigestion domain symptoms were similar across groups, but patients with low FE-1 were heavier and reported lower stool frequency. FE-1 levels correlated positively with plasma levels of amylase, lipase, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and albumin. Mean EPA + DHA exposure was similarly higher after intake of free vs. esterified omega-3 fatty acids in all FE-1 groups.
Conclusions: The prevalence of low FE-1 (<100 μg/g) as a measure of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was infrequent in type 2 diabetes. Except for low plasma concentrations of EPA and 25-hydroxy vitamin D, type 2 diabetes patients with low FE-1 had no other signs of malabsorption or gastrointestinal disorders. Plasma levels of EPA and DHA after the intake of esterified versus free EPA and DHA did not correlate with FE-1 levels.

36,What is necessary to diagnose constipation?,Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol,Satish S C Rao,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2010.11.001,"Constipation is a common ailment with multiple symptoms and diverse etiology. Understanding the pathophysiology is important to guide optimal management. During the past few years, there have been remarkable developments in the diagnosis of constipation and defecation disorders. Several innovative manometric, neurophysiologic, and radiologic techniques have been discovered, which have improved the accuracy of identifying the neuromuscular mechanisms of chronic constipation. These include use of digital rectal examination, Bristol stool scale, colonic scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule for assessment of colonic and whole gut transit, high resolution anorectal manometry, and colonic manometry. These tests provide a better definition of the underlying mechanism(s), which in turn can lead to improved management of this condition. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in diagnostic testing with a particular emphasis on when and why to test, and discuss the utility of diagnostic tests for chronic constipation."
37,Prediction of Delayed Colonic Transit Using Bristol Stool Form and Stool Frequency in Eastern Constipated Patients: A Difference From the West,J Neurogastroenterol Motil,Veeravich Jaruvongvanich,https://doi.org/10.5056/jnm17022,"Background/aims: The correlation between the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) and colonic transit time (CTT) has been reported in Western populations. Our study aims to study the relationship between BSFS, stool frequency, and CTT in Eastern patients with chronic constipation.
Methods: A total of 144 chronic functional constipation patients underwent colonic transit study by using radio-opaque markers, anorectal manometry, and balloon expulsion test. Stool diary including stool forms and frequency was recorded. Delayed CTT was defined as the retention of more than 20.0% of radio-opaque markers in the colon on day 5.
Results: Twenty-five patients (17.4%) had delayed colonic transit. Mean 5-day BSFS (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.79; P = 0.021) and stool frequency (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83; P = 0.002) were independently associated with delayed CTT by logistic regression analysis. Mean 5-day BSFS (area under the curve [AUC], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P < 0.001) and stool frequency (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.87; P < 0.001) fairly predicted delayed CTT. The optimal mean 5-day BSFS of ??3 provided 68.0% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity, and 69.4% accuracy, and the optimal stool frequency ??2 bowel movements in 5 days provided 64.0% sensitivity, 83.1% specificity, and 84.0% accuracy for predicting delayed CTT.
Conclusions: Both stool form and frequency were significantly associated with delayed CTT. Stool frequency ??2 and BSFS 1-3 rather than BSFS 1-2 that was used in the Westerners could be used as surrogate for delayed CTT in Eastern patients with constipation."
38,Assessing Children's Report of Stool Consistency: Agreement Between the Pediatric Rome III Questionnaire and the Bristol Stool Scale,J Pediatr,Mana H Vriesman,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.07.002,"Objectives: To assess the agreement between the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III (QPGS-RIII) and the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) in evaluating stool consistency and the diagnosis of functional constipation in children.
Study design: Children aged 8-18 years were asked to describe their stool consistency in the previous month according to the QPGS-RIII and the BSS. Stool consistency according to both instruments was categorized into 3 categories: ""hard,"" ""normal,"" and ""liquid."" The children's reported stool consistency using the QPGS-RIII and the BSS were compared, and the intrarater agreement between the 2 instruments was measured using the Cohen kappa coefficient (κ). The diagnosis of functional constipation was based on the Rome III criteria, incorporating the assessment of stool consistency according to the QPGS-RIII and the BSS.
Results: A total of 1835 children were included. Only slight agreement existed between the QPGS-RIII and the BSS for assessing stool consistency (κ = .046; P = .022). Significantly more children reported hard stools on the BSS compared to the QPGS-RIII (18.0% vs 7.1%; P = .000). The prevalence of functional constipation was 8.6% using the QPGS-RIII and 9.3% using the BSS (P = .134).
Conclusions: Only slight agreement exists between the QPGS-RIII and the BSS in the evaluation of stool consistency in children. Better instruments are needed to assess the consistency of stools with a high degree of reliability, both in research and in the clinical setting."

40,Real-life study of the effectiveness of a high calorie and high protein formula in the maintenance and improvement of nutritional state in patients with an indication of long-term enteral nutrition,Endocrinol Diabetes Nutr (Engl Ed),Marcia D Ballesteros Pomar,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endinu.2020.03.010,"The selection of the most appropriate formula in long-term home enteral nutrition is a controversial issue. Our objective was to study a high protein hypercaloric enteral nutrition formula in patients with long-term feeding (180 days).
Methods: Prospective observational multicenter real-life study with high-protein hypercaloric formula (2kcal/ml and 20% protein). General, anthropometric, analytical and quality of life data were collected by visual analog scale of the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at the beginning, 60, 120 and 180 days. Gastrointestinal tolerance was assessed with a visual analog scale and Bristol Stool Scale and the risk of malnutrition was assessed using NRS-2002.
Results: 51 patients (88.2% men, mean age 62.0 years), with oncological diseases in 72.5%. No differences in anthropometric data were observed, although the percentage of patients at risk of malnutrition according to NRS 2002 was reduced from 75% to 8.3% (p<0.0001). No differences were observed in albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, lymphocytes or hematocrit. The quality of life improved from 3.84 (1.27) to 5.37 (1.12) on the visual analog scale (p<0.0001). A reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms was observed throughout the period of enteral nutrition. Both the number and percentage of stools considered normal according to the Bristol scale remained stable.
Conclusion: Our study supports that the use of high-protein hypercaloric formulas during a 6-month nutritional treatment allows an adequate nutritional evolution without risk of dehydration and with a good tolerance, even improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, and can contribute to an improvement in the quality of lifetime."
41,Evaluation of the Symptom of Constipation in Indian Patients,J Clin Diagn Res,Gautam Ray,https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2016/15487.7524,"Introduction: The exact prevalence of constipation in India is unknown. To know this, first it has to be properly defined based on stool frequency and form (as in western definition) in Indian patients, data on which is scarce. There may be difference with the western definition also.
Aim: To determine the stool frequency and form in patients consulting doctor for the complaint of constipation and compare these with the Western definition of constipation.
Materials and methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study on 331 consecutive patients seeking medical advice for their complaint of constipation. They were administered a questionnaire containing Rome III criteria points of functional constipation and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome and the Bristol stool chart to report their predominant stool form. Organic bowel diseases were excluded by further history taking, physical examination and appropriate investigations. The data on stool frequency and form thus obtained were compared with the existing Indian population data.
Results: A total of 65% patients were above 60 years of age. The predominant stool types were 1-3 according to Bristol stool form scale present in 93.8% patients and conformed to Asian criteria of constipation by stool form. Only 67.9% patients passed Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 1 and 2 stool which is the western definition. 51.5% reported a frequency of 3-4 motions/week, 19.8% had normal stool frequency by Indian standard (i.e. at least 1 motion/day) and only 35.4% had constipation by Western criteria (less than 3 motions/week). Hence subjective feeling varied widely from observed rate and Western definition was invalid in about twothird of patients. Feeling of incomplete evacuation was universal and this was referred to as constipation by patients. Functional constipation was diagnosed in 69.1% (of whom most were elderly with co-morbidities) and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome in 13.8% by Indian standard. Only 2.1% had colonic cancer.
Conclusion: A stool frequency of <5 motions/week appears more appropriate in Indian definition of constipation where the subjective feeling of incomplete evacuation should also be given due weightage. Asian criteria based on stool form holds true in India."
42,Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Quality of Life in Women With Fecal Incontinence,Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg,Alayne D Markland,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000000358,"Objectives: The objectives of this work were to determine the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBS subtypes in women presenting for fecal incontinence (FI) treatment and to assess the impact of IBS on FI symptoms and quality of life (QOL).
Methods: In this multicenter prospective cohort study, women reported at least monthly solid, liquid, or mucus FI. Rome III clinical criteria defined IBS. Women also self-reported having an IBS diagnosis. Baseline questionnaires included the following: Modified Manchester Health Questionnaire, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Bristol Stool Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire.
Results: Of the 133 women enrolled, 119 completed Rome III IBS questionnaires, and 111 reported on whether they had a previous diagnosis of IBS. The prevalence of IBS was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.9%-40.2%) according to the Rome III IBS criteria. The most common subtypes were IBS-mixed (41%) and IBS-diarrhea (35%). Twenty-four (22%) of 111 patients had a previous diagnosis of IBS. Among women who met Rome III IBS criteria, 23 (66%) of 35 women had never had a diagnosis of IBS. Women with FI and IBS reported significantly worse QOL compared to women without IBS despite similar FI severity and stool consistency.
Conclusions: Irritable bowel syndrome negatively affects QOL and affects one third of women with FI presenting for care in tertiary centers. Our findings suggest that assessment of IBS symptoms and diagnosis may be important for women presenting for FI treatment."
43,Gastrointestinal adverse reactions reduce the success rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy: A multicenter prospective cohort study,Helicobacter,Toshihiko Kakiuchi,https://doi.org/10.1111/hel.12776,"Background: The screening and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection for all junior high students in Saga Prefecture, Japan, were started in 2016. The present study aims to evaluate the influence of adverse reactions on the success of the eradication therapy.
Methods: From 2017 to 2019, 25,006 third-grade junior high school students were tested for urinary anti-H. pylori antibodies. Positive cases were confirmed by H. pylori stool antigen tests. Of the 531 students who were found to be H. pylori-positive, 390 (358 in first-line and 32 in second-line therapy) underwent eradication therapy, and 274 (242 in first-line and 32 in second-line) students actually completed a self-reported form to rate stool consistency (based on the Bristol Stool Scale), the maximum number of bowel movements, and abdominal symptoms during the 7 days of treatment.
Results: Among the 274 students, the total of primary and secondary eradication success rates was 87% (95% confidential interval: 82.9-90.1) in intention-to-treat analysis. On days 4, 5, and 6, stool consistency was looser in the primary eradication failure group than in the success group (p < .05). Looser stool consistencies were observed in male students with abdominal pain compared to those who did not experience pain (p < .05). Abdominal pain and diarrhea were detected in 28.5% and 42.7% of the subjects, respectively. The overall incidence of other adverse events was low (n = 8/274, 2.9%), and only two students discontinued treatment because of adverse events.
Conclusions: Softening of the stool was related to the eradication failure in the junior high school students, especially in males with abdominal pain. Adverse effects did not induce discontinuation of the eradication treatment."
44,Constipation in Elderly Patients with Noncancer Pain: Focus on Opioid-Induced Constipation,Drugs Aging,Sita Chokhavatia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-016-0381-2,"Constipation is a common and often debilitating condition in the elderly, which may be caused by underlying disease conditions, structural abnormalities in the bowel, and a variety of medications such as anticholinergics, antidepressants, and opiates. In this review, we focus on opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is often underrecognized and undertreated in the elderly. When opioid therapy is initiated, healthcare providers are encouraged to evaluate risk factors for the development of constipation as part of a thorough patient history. To this end, the patient assessment should include the use of validated instruments, such as the Bristol Stool Scale and Bowel Function Index, to confirm the diagnosis and provide a basis for evaluating treatment outcomes. Healthcare providers should use a stepwise approach to the treatment of OIC in the elderly. Conventional laxatives are a first-line option and considered well tolerated with short-term use as needed; however, evidence is lacking to support their effectiveness in OIC. Moreover, because of the risk of adverse events and other considerations, such as chewing difficulties and swallowing disorders, conventional oral laxatives may be inappropriate for the treatment of OIC in the elderly. Thus, the availability of new pharmacologic agents such as the peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists methylnaltrexone and naloxegol, which target the underlying causes of OIC, and the secretagogue lubiprostone may provide more effective treatment options for elderly patients with OIC."
45,Somatostatin analogues for refractory diarrhoea in familial amyloid polyneuropathy,PLoS One,Michael Collins,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201869,"Introduction: Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a genetic disease leading to the production of a variant transthyretin (TTR) or a beta variant β2-microglobulin. FAP may be associated with refractory diarrhoea. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and tolerance of somatostatin analogues in refractory diarrhoea associated with FAP.
Methods: FAP patients from the French national referral center who received somatostatin analogues for a refractory diarrhoea were retrospectively studied. We assessed remission of diarrhoea, as defined by a stool consistence of five or less on the Bristol stool scale, assessed after three to six months of follow-up. Stool frequency and continence before and after three to six months of treatment were also compared by the means of Wilcoxon and McNemar's exact tests, respectively.
Results: Fourteen patients treated with somatostatin analogues were evaluable. After three to six months of follow-up, 9/14 patients (64% 95%CI = [35%; 87%]) had remission of diarrhoea. This was significantly higher than a theoretical remission rate of 20% (p = 0.0004). There was a significant decrease of daily bowel movement from 6 to 2.5 per day (p = 0.002). Twelve/14 (85%) patients had incontinence at baseline vs 8/14 (57%) after three to six months of follow-up (p = 0.134). Three out of 14 patients (21%) had a severe adverse event; two patients had hypoglycaemia, and one had endocarditis due to an injection-site bacterial infection.
Conclusion: This study suggests that somatostatin analogues may benefit to patients with FAP and refractory diarrhoea. Approximately 20% of patients had severe adverse events, including hypoglycaemia."
46,Topical therapy with rhubarb navel plasters in patients with chronic constipation: Results from a prospective randomized multicenter study,J Ethnopharmacol,Lin Wei,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113096,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disorder and one of the most prevalent conditions encountered in primary care settings. Rhubarb navel dressings have been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat constipation. However, the effect of topical rhubarb administration has still not been well recognized and this strategy is not yet established as an evidence-based approach.
Aim of the study: In this study, we performed a prospective multicentric randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhubarb navel plasters for patients with chronic constipation.
Materials and methods: A total of 374 patients from six teaching hospitals were prospectively included between 09/2016 and 10/2017 in the study based on Rome III criteria. All participants were randomly assigned (1:1) into verum/placebo group and given either Rheum officinale rhubarb powder or a placebo flour stick on the navel for 6 h/day/8 days. Primary outcome measures were the Cleveland Constipation Score (CCS) for the feces condition and Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) for stool consistency and 24 h defecation frequency.
Results: The groups demonstrated no statistical differences in demographic data, clinical diagnoses and concomitant medication at baseline. In patients treated with the verum CCS was 5.61 (day 8, 95% CI 5.15-6.07) compared to 8.62 (95% CI 8.07-9.18) in placebo-treated controls (P < 0.001). The mean change of CCS at the end of treatment (day 8 versus [vs] day 0) was 6.04 in verum-treated vs 2.73 in placebo-treated controls (P < 0.001). Also 24 h defecation frequency (BSS) showed superior results (day 5: 0.84 vs 0.62, 95% CI 0.67-0.80, P < 0.001; day 6: 0.82 vs 0.60, 95% CI 0.64-0.78, P < 0.01 and day 8: 0.82 vs 0.60, 95% CI 0.64-0.78, P < 0.01) and better BSS type classification during treatment than controls (P < 0.05). No significant differences in adverse events between both groups became obvious.
Conclusion: Rhubarb navel plaster administration over an 8-day-treatment period resulted in significantly improved bowel function as demonstrated by the CCS, 24 h defecating frequency and BSS. Our results suggest that rhubarb navel plasters represent a feasible, safe and efficient application route for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic constipation."
47,Time to treatment response of a magnesium- and sulphate-rich natural mineral water in functional constipation,Nutrition,Christophe Dupont,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.02.018,"Objectives: First-line recommendations for the management of functional constipation include nutritional-hygienic measures. We previously showed that a natural mineral water rich in sulphates and magnesium (Hépar) is efficient in the treatment of functional constipation. The aim of this study was to consolidate those first results and determine a precise time to respond to Hépar.
Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of the effect of Hépar on stool consistency and frequency in functional constipation included 226 outpatients. After washout, patients used 1.5 L of water daily, including 1 L of Hépar or of low-mineral water, during 14 d. In addition to a daily reporting of stool consistency by the patient, an expert investigator blindly analyzed stool consistency (Bristol stool scale) based on photographs taken by the patient.
Results: The primary endpoint was met. Treatment response was more frequent in the Hépar arm than in the control group at day 14 (50% versus 29%, respectively; P = 0.001). Mean time to treatment response was shorter in the Hépar group (6.4 d) than in the control arm (7.3 d; P = 0.013). Concomitant stool scoring was available for 60% of the patients. Scores given to 79% of the stools were similar between the patient and the expert (differences ??). Safety analyses showed excellent results.
Conclusion: This study confirms the efficacy and safety of Hépar in the treatment of functional constipation and shows that it is associated with a response within 7 d. Hépar could be a safe response to the current absence of first-line medication in the treatment of functional constipation."
48,"Feasibility of Low Fermentable Oligosaccharide, Disaccharide, Monosaccharide, and Polyol Diet and Its Effects on Quality of Life in an Italian Cohort",Nutrients,Arianna Cingolani,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12030716,"The low Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet has demonstrated excellent results in terms of symptom control and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sufferers, but patients have complained about unsatisfying taste, difficulty in following the diet, and time consumption. To investigate the feasibility of the low FODMAP diet in an Italian (Sardinian) cohort, sixty consecutive eligible outpatients (11 men and 49 women) with IBS were enrolled and followed a low FODMAP diet (gluten allowed, restriction phase of four weeks, reintroduction phase of four weeks). Food habits were assessed using 24-hour dietary recall, Bristol Stool Scale for stool consistency, Visual Analogue Scale for abdominal bloating, VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for abdominal pain, IBS Severity Scoring System for perceived disease severity, and a 12-item Short Form Survey for HRQoL (psychological component summary + mental component summary) were applied at baseline (T0) and at the end of each phase (T1-four weeks and T2-eight weeks). Statistical analysis was performed by dividing the cohort into diarrhoea-dominant IBS (IBS-D) and other IBS subtypes (selected IBS-others). Comparisons between T1 and T2 vs. T0 and T2 vs. T1 were performed. The low FODMAP diet lowered VASp (VAS pain), VASb (VAS bloating), and IBS SSS (IBS Severity Scoring System), and increased PCS (Physical Component Summary) and MCS (Mental Component Summary) in both subgroups. Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) only improved in the IBS-D subgroup. The dropout mean values for MCS were higher than treated subjects and the percentage of unemployment was lower in the dropouts. According to the dropout features, the low FODMAP diet seems to show greater feasibility for patients with more time to dedicate to the diet (unemployed, homemakers, housewives, or students), more motivation, and more severe clinical features, independent of their place of residence."
49,Clinical correlates of faecal incontinence in systemic sclerosis: identifying therapeutic avenues,Rheumatology (Oxford),Nicolas Richard,https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kew441,"Objectives: The aim was to establish the prevalence and severity of faecal incontinence (FI) in SSc, its association with other intestinal manifestations and potential predictors of FI, and its impact on quality of life.
Methods: A multicentre, cross-sectional study of 298 SSc subjects followed in the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group cohort was performed using validated questionnaires: Jorge-Wexner score (an FI severity scale), Bristol stool scale (a visual scale of stool consistency) and FI Quality-of-Life scale. Constipation was defined by the Rome III criteria. Associations between the Jorge-Wexner score and other clinical variables were determined using multivariate regression analyses.
Results: Eighty-one (27.2%) subjects had FI, which was mild in 37 (12.4%) and moderate to severe in 44 (14.8%). Most patients had well-formed stools, 111 (38.8%) reported constipation and 38 (13.4%) had been previously treated for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Variables independently associated with FI were: loose vs well-formed stools [odds ratio (OR) = 7.01, 95% CI: 2.09, 23.51)], constipation (OR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.61, 8.27, P = 0.002), history of SIBO (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06, 8.27) and urinary incontinence (OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.27). Quality of life measured with the FI Quality-of-Life scale was inversely correlated with FI severity (correlation coefficients between -0.602 and -0.702, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: FI was common and often severe in SSc. Loose stools, SIBO, constipation and urinary incontinence were strongly associated with FI. Other than targeting anorectal dysfunction, concomitant treatment of clinical correlates could lead to improvement in FI and quality of life in SSc."
50,Role of a berberine-based nutritional supplement in reducing diarrhea in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders,Minerva Gastroenterol Dietol,Francesco Di Pierro,https://doi.org/10.23736/s1121-421x.19.02649-7,"Background: Berberine, an alkaloid obtained by extraction from Berberis spp., is a botanical that is widely used in the nutraceutical sector to control cholesterol and blood glucose levels. It is also a molecule that is effective in limiting diarrhea due to its multi-factorial properties, including its antimicrobial, gut eubiotic and antisecretive actions, and its ability to slow gut motility. In our routine clinical practice, we have suggested the use of a berberine-based nutraceutical, formulated with melatonin and depolymerized guar gum, to patients affected by functional diarrhea (FD) or by diarrhea-type irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
Methods: We have therefore retrospectively analyzed the clinical effect of such a nutritional supplement in these two sub-groups of patients.
Results: Despite the highly pragmatic scheme of our study, our findings strongly confirm the antidiarrheal properties of berberine and recommend its use in some gut functional diseases characterized by frequent evacuation of mushy and/or watery stools. In fact, even after 30 days of treatment, the berberine-based nutritional supplement significantly reduces diarrheal events by 50-70%. After 90 days, this reduction improves to between 70 and 80%, with a reduction of more than 60% in the number of evacuations per week and with more than 50% of treated subjects demonstrating normalized, according to self-reported Bristol Stool Scale categorization, stool consistency. The product is well tolerated and adherence to the proposed therapy is good. Common side effects of the product are flatulence and meteorism, likely due to the ""acarbose-like"" berberine effects on gut α-glucosidase.
Conclusions: Patients, especially those preferring ""natural"" therapy, can be successfully treated, when affected by a gut functional disease characterized by diarrhea, by berberine-based products."
51,Intestinal Permeability Measured by Urinary Sucrose Excretion Correlates with Serum Zonulin and Faecal Calprotectin Concentrations in UC Patients in Remission,J Nutr Metab,C A M Wegh,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2472754,"Background and aims: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with an increased intestinal permeability, possibly through a dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria. We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether probiotics had an effect on these markers.
Methods: In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies probiotics. Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBD-Q).
Results: This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The IBD-Q score, 194 for the probiotics group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin (r = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin (r = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.
Conclusion: Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active disease or shortly after a flare up."

Subjects and methods: A total of 110 people (45 men, 65 women) aged 45 to 72 years with CC in the presence of concomitant diseases: grade 1 or 2 hypertensive disease + obesity + type 2 DM. The investigators determined the severity of abdominal pain syndrome and flatulence, by indicating the mean frequency of defecations per week and fecal consistency according to the Bristol stool scale; anthropometric parameters; serum biochemistry tests; and serum lipoprotein phenotyping. Quality of life was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. The patients were divided into 3 groups according their use of agents: 1) dietary fiber (psyllium); 2) osmotic laxatives (disaccharides); 3) osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol).
Results: The patients taking psyllium to treat constipation showed an increasing frequency of defecations and normalization of stool consistency. Incorporating psyllium into combination therapy was accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A similar trend was observed for serum triglycerides. The patients receiving combination therapy including other laxatives displayed no significant differences between lipid metabolic parameters at the beginning and after the end of treatment.
Conclusion: The whole complex of properties of psyllium (Mucofalk) can be fully realized in patients with comorbidity and chronic constipation, which is accompanied not only by the normalization of bowel emptying, but also by marked positive changes in the main lipid metabolic parameters and by a reduction in overweight."
53,Validation of the Taiwan Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-CR29 to assess quality of life in colorectal cancer patients,BMC Cancer,Ming-Hung Shen,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4312-y,"Background: The increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in Taiwan has generated a need for a disease-specific quality-of-life measuring instrument. We aimed to validate the Taiwan Chinese version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29.
Methods: A total of 108 patients were interviewed. Convergent and discriminant validity, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, test-retest reliability, and known-groups comparisons were used to examine the reliability and validity.
Results: We found good internal consistency reliability for multi-item scales of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29, except for the cognitive function and pain scale of the QLQ-C30. Patients in the active treatment group reported compromised functional scale scores (global health status/quality of life, QLQ-C30) and worse symptoms (blood and mucus in stool, QLQ-CR29) than those in the follow-up group. Similar results were found in comparisons based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status and Bristol Stool Scale: higher physical function/sexual interest, less fatigue/urine frequency symptoms for patients with the lowest ECOG Performance Status (Grade 0), and borderline worse stool frequency scores from Types 5 and 6 patients on the Bristol Stool Scale.
Conclusion: The study validated the Taiwan Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29. The clinical applicability warrants further studies with greater number of participants."
54,Clinical evaluation of a non-purified direct molecular assay for the detection of Clostridioides difficile toxin genes in stool specimens,PLoS One,Toshinori Hara,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234119,"Recently, a new rapid assay for the detection of tcdB gene of Clostridioides difficile was developed using the GENECUBE. The assay can directly detect the tcdB gene from stool samples without a purification in approximately 35 minutes with a few minutes of preparation process. We performed a prospective comparative study of the performance of the assay at eight institutions in Japan. Fresh residual stool samples (Bristol stool scale ??) were used and comparisons were performed with the BD MAX Cdiff assay and toxigenic cultures. For the evaluation of 383 stool samples compared with the BD MAX Cdiff assay, the sensitivity, and specificity of the two assays was 99.0% (379/383), 98.1% (52/53), 99.1% (327/330), respectively. In the comparison with toxigenic culture, the total, sensitivity, and specificity were 96.6% (370/383), 85.0% (51/60), and 98.8% (319/323), respectively. The current investigation indicated the GENECUBE Clostridioides difficile assay has equivalent performance with the BD MAX Cdiff assay for the detection of tcdB gene of C. difficile."
55,Dietary exclusion of fructose and lactose after positive breath tests improved rapid-transit constipation in children,JGH Open,Kasturi Waingankar,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12079,"Aims: Exclusion of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) from the diet is effective in alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. Rapid-transit constipation (RTC) is a recently discovered subset of chronic constipation and has been linked to food intolerance. The aim of this study was to audit the effect of specific FODMAP elimination diets in children with RTC.
Methods: This was an audit of children presenting to a tertiary children's hospital surgeon with refractory chronic constipation who had rapid transit in the proximal colon on nuclear imaging; had hydrogen/methane breath tests for fructose, lactose, and/or sorbitol intolerance; and were advised to exclude positive sugar under clinical supervision. Patients filled in a questionnaire rating severity of constipation, abdominal pain, and pain on defecation with a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 = none, 10 = high) and stool consistency for 6 months before and after dietary exclusion.
Results: In responses from 29 children (5-15 years, 21 males), 70% eliminated fructose, and 40% eliminated lactose. There was a significant reduction in the severity of constipation (VAS mean ± SEM, pre 5.8 ± 0.5 vs post 3.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (5.1 ± 0.6 vs 2.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.0004), pain on defecation (5.8 ± 0.6 vs 2.6 ± 0.5, P < 0.0001), and increase in stool wetness (Bristol Stool Scale pre 3.3 ± 0.3 vs post 3.9 ± 0.2, P = 0.004).
Conclusion: Children with RTC showed significant improvements in constipation and pain after excluding the sugar indicated by positive breath tests, suggesting that specific sugar-exclusion diets may have a role in the management of RTC in children."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefits of a probiotic combination (Limosilactibacillus reuteri LRE02-DSM 23878 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR04-DSM 16605) on the prevention of AAD in an outpatient pediatric setting. Questionnaires were delivered to pediatricians by each patient/parent during the visits after antibiotics and probiotics treatment to monitor physiological parameters. The primary outcome of both groups (probiotics and no probiotics treated) was the evaluation of the prevalence of AAD between the two groups. Evaluation of stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score was performed, as well as the evaluation of AAD duration, frequencies of daily evacuation, and the beginning of diarrhea and weight loss during AAD in both groups and related to antibiotic categories. Results indicated that probiotics, at the recommended dosage of 1.2 × 109 CFU (Colony Forming Unit) per day for 30 days, are associated with lower rates of AAD and a decreased number of days with diarrhea, independent of the type of antibiotic used. Moreover, the use of probiotics resulted in a normal stool consistency in a shorter time period, as evaluated by the BSS."

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of Actazin and Gold, kiwifruit-derived nutritional ingredients, on stool frequency, stool form, and gastrointestinal comfort in healthy and functionally constipated (Rome III criteria for C3 functional constipation) individuals. Using a crossover design, all participants consumed all 4 dietary interventions (Placebo, Actazin low dose [Actazin-L] [600 mg/day], Actazin high dose [Actazin-H] [2400 mg/day], and Gold [2400 mg/day]). Each intervention was taken for 28 days followed by a 14-day washout period between interventions. Participants recorded their daily bowel movements and well-being parameters in daily questionnaires. In the healthy cohort (n = 19), the Actazin-H (P = .014) and Gold (P = .009) interventions significantly increased the mean daily bowel movements compared with the washout. No significant differences were observed in stool form as determined by use of the Bristol stool scale. In a subgroup analysis of responders in the healthy cohort, Actazin-L (P = .005), Actazin-H (P < .001), and Gold (P = .001) consumption significantly increased the number of daily bowel movements by greater than 1 bowel movement per week. In the functionally constipated cohort (n = 9), there were no significant differences between interventions for bowel movements and the Bristol stool scale values or in the subsequent subgroup analysis of responders. This study demonstrated that Actazin and Gold produced clinically meaningful increases in bowel movements in healthy individuals."
58,[Efficacy of pectin in the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome],Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,Lin Xu,,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of pectin, a kind of soluble dietary fiber, in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome(IBS-D).
Methods: A total of 87 patients with IBS-D were selected in the Jinling Hospital between July 2011 and December 2013. Using a randomized, controlled trial, the efficacy of pectin for IBS-D was prospectively evaluated. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 24 g pectin powder/d (n=46) or a placebo (n=41). Before and after 6 weeks of treatment, colonic microflora was examined by real-time PCR and compared between groups. Changes in stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale), composite score of symptoms (Likert scale) and QOL scores (IBS-QOL questionnaire) were also monitored. Peripheral blood sample from patients with IBS-D was obtained to estimate the cytokines level, which was compared with that obtained from a group of age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (n=20).
Results: Those patients randomized to pectin experienced a greater reduction in composite symptom scores and Bristol stool scale scores, as well as significant improvement in QOL scores (P<0.05). The pectin acted as prebiotics and significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria and decreased total Clostridium sp (P<0.05). At baseline, patients with IBS-D demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, which was normalized by pectin feeding alone (P<0.01). Placebo did not exert these effects on the aforementioned parameters after treatment. No significant adverse effects were reported during the study.
Conclusions: Pectin acts as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS-D patients and is effective in alleviating clinical symptoms, balancing colonic microflora and relieving systemic inflammation. In view of its ability to re-establish a healthy gut ecosystem, pectin has the potential of being a therapeutic agent in IBS-D."
59,How adding the abdominal massage to polyethylene glycol can improve symptom and quality of life in patients with functional constipation in comparison with each one of the treatment modalities alone: A randomized clinical trial,Complement Ther Med,Marjan Mokhtare,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102495,"Background: A variety of medical and non-medical treatments have been introduced for functional constipation relief. Here, we aimed to compare the efficacy of a combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and abdominal massage with each one of the treatments alone.
Materials and methods: Patients with functional constipation based on Rome IV criteria were randomly assigned into the three treatment groups: group A (abdominal massage for 15 min daily), group B (PEG 20 g daily), and group C (PEG 20 g plus abdominal massage for 15 min daily) for 14 days. PAC-QOL questionnaire, Bristol stool scale were evaluated at baseline and two weeks after treatment. Constipation-associated symptom scores were recorded at baseline, two weeks and four weeks after treatment beginning. Descriptive statistics were provided as the mean ± standard deviation or number and percentage. P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Forty eight, 47 and 48 patients in group A, B, and C completed the study, respectively. PAC-QOL, Bristol and Constipation-associated symptom scores showed a significant improvement in all study groups two weeks after the treatment compared to the baseline. At the end of treatment, the rate of straining, incomplete evacuation sensation, finger evacuation and the number of defecation was significantly lower in the group C (P < 0.04). Bristol score were significantly improved in group B (P = 0.029) in compare to other groups. The total quality of life score was also significantly improved in the group C (P = 0.028).
Conclusion: A combination of abdominal massage and PEG is safe, tolerable and more effective than each one of the treatments alone."

This is a multicentre double-blind study with sequential design for multiple dose groups and randomised crossover for comparators of placebo vs dose.
Subjects/methods: A total of 185 healthy young children aged 4-6 years were recruited at three clinical investigation centres after informed consent of both parents; 184 children completed the study. Children were included in one of the four dose groups (5, 15, 20 or 25 g erythritol) and exposed randomly to only one single dose vs an isosweet sucrose placebo. After consumption in the clinic and an observation period, GI symptoms and stooling patterns were recorded during the next 48 h.
Results: Statistically significantly more episodes of diarrhoea and/or severe GI symptoms were observed in the 20 and 25 g groups compared with placebo, but not in the 5 and 15 g groups. Stool consistency, as measured by Bristol stool scale, was lower in the 15-, 20- and 25 g groups for the first 24 -h period, but not at later time points. Incidences of nausea, vomiting, borborygmi, excess flatus and abdominal pain were not significantly different from the placebo controls at all doses of erythritol.
Conclusions: Rapid ingestion of up to and including 15 g (6% w/v) of erythritol in a beverage in between meals by young children aged 4-6 years was well tolerated. The no observed effect level for diarrhoea and/or severe GI symptoms was 15 g (0.73 g/kg body weight (bw)). Children appeared not to be more sensitive to the GI effects of erythritol than published for adults on a g/kg bw basis."
61,The prevalence and therapeutic effect of constipation in pediatric overactive bladder,Int Neurourol J,Ji Hyun Kim,https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.2011.15.4.206,"Purpose: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a manifestation of urgency, regardless of urge incontinence, due to involuntary bladder contraction during the storage period. There is a close association between constipation and OAB, but constipation cannot be readily diagnosed. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of constipation in OAB and the consequent therapeutic effects according to the diagnostic criteria for constipation.
Methods: We collected clinical data from 40 children (mean age, 71±22 months) with chief complaints of urgency, frequency, and incontinence. A voiding questionnaire and a 2-day voiding diary were collected, and urinalysis, the Bristol stool scale, and plain abdominal radiography were performed. Constipation was defined as conditions satisfying at least one of the following criteria: Rome III diagnostic criteria, Bristol stool scale types I/II, or a Leech score higher than 8 points as determined by plain radiography. Lower urinary tract symptoms, defecation symptoms, and the bladder volume of patients were examined, and the therapeutic outcomes by constipation diagnostic criteria were evaluated.
Results: Of the 40 OAB patients, 25 had constipation. Among them, 6 had reduced functional bladder capacity (24%; P>0.05). Regarding treatment, in patients who satisfied only one diagnostic criterion, the symptoms improved in 76.9%, 76.9%, and 69.6% of patients meeting the Rome III criteria, Bristol stool scale, and Leech score, respectively (P<0.05). Among the 8 patients satisfying all three criteria, 75% responded to treatment (P<0.05).
Conclusions: The prevalence of constipation in OAB is high. Constipated patients recruited by use of the Rome III criteria, Bristol scale, and Leech score alone and together showed similar outcomes on OAB improvement after the treatment of constipation, which implies that each criterion has the same strength and can be applied comprehensively and generally."

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a vaginal bowel control system on parameters of bowel function, including frequency, urgency, stool consistency, and evacuation.
Design: This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective clinical trial.
Settings: This study was conducted at 6 sites in the United States, including university hospitals and private practices in urogynecology and colorectal surgery.
Patients: A total of 56 evaluable female subjects aged 19 to 75 years with 4 or more fecal incontinence episodes on a 2-week bowel diary were included.
Interventions: The study intervention was composed of the vaginal bowel control system, consisting of a vaginal insert and pressure-regulated pump.
Main outcome measures: Subjects completed a 2-week baseline diary of bowel function before and after treatment completed at 1 month. Fecal urgency, consistency of stool (Bristol score), and completeness of evacuation were recorded for all bowel movements.
Results: Use of the insert was associated with an improvement in bowel function across all 4 categories. Two thirds (8/12) of subjects with a high frequency of daily stools (more than 2 per day) shifted to a normal or low frequency of stools. Analysis of Bristol stool scale scores demonstrated a significant reduction in the proportion of all bowel movements reported as liquid (Bristol 6 or 7), from 36% to 21% (p = 0.0001). On average, 54% of stools were associated with urgency at baseline compared with 26% at 1 month (p < 0.0001). Incomplete evacuations with all bowel movements were reduced from 39% to 26% of subjects at 1 month (p = 0.0034).
Limitations: The study follow-up period was 1 month (with an optional additional 2 months).
Conclusions: The vaginal bowel control system was associated with an improvement in bowel symptoms and function, including reduced bowel movement frequency, less fecal urgency, increased solid consistency, and improved evacuation in patients with significant fecal incontinence."
63,[Using a multicomponent functional food in IBS patients with constipation a comparative controlled study],Vopr Pitan,V I Pilipenko,,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with decrease in quality of life and a high social cost. Diet is one of several therapeutic options in IBS treatment; therefore the development and clinical evaluation of innovative functional food for IBS patients are actual. Instant drink containing 4 g inulin, 4 mg menthol and 2 mg of pyridoxine (in daily dose) has been evaluated. 49 patients 18-68 (41.5±16.5) years old fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS-C were randomly assigned into two groups: one received standard diet plus two drinks per day for 2 weeks and control group received standard diet. Response to therapy was recorded daily using Likert scale of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete bowel emptying, frequency of bowel movement, Bristol stool scale, and quality of life was assessed by IBSQoL questionnaire before and after the treatment. The consumption of the drink with inulin and menthol contributed to a significant positive effect on the stool parameters (from 0.91±0.73 to 1.12±0.45 bowel movements per day in stool frequency, p=0.05, from 2.68±1.63 to 3.43±1.27 index Bristol scale, p=0.05), reduced the severity of abdominal pain (from 1.78±0.58 to 1.47?0.61 Likert scale points, p=0.05), bloating (from 2.22±0.83 to 1.53±0.71 points ofLikertscale,p= 0.01) and a sense of incomplete bowelemptying (from 2.22 ± 0.88 to 1.61± 0.81 points of Likert scale, p=0.001), as well as increased the quality of life (from 75.3± 12.0 to 83.3±6.7%, p=0.05), but a significant part of patients (10 of 25) complained the appearance of heartburn after the start of the treatment. In conclusion, the consumption of the functional drink containing inulin, menthol and pyridoxine is associated with improve in stool parameters, abdominal pain, Bristol scale index and increase in quality of life in patients with IBS-C, but produce noticeable heartburn. Changes in functional drink composition are needed to reduce adverse effects."
64,Electrical stimulation therapy for slow transit constipation in children: a systematic review,Int J Colorectal Dis,Ming-Liang Lu,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-015-2180-3,"Purpose: Slow transit constipation is a common disorder in children, which often does not respond well to ordinary treatments. We have conducted a systematic review of reported studies in order to better define the current state of knowledge about electrical stimulation treatment of slow transit constipation in children.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, BioMed Central, and ISI Web of Knowledge with relevant terms; six studies, all from one center, met the criteria for inclusion. Two trials were randomized clinical trials, and four were prospective studies. The number of subjects included in the studies was 8 to 39, with ages 3 to 18 years.
Results: Treatment sessions varied from 20 to 30 min 3 times per week to 1 h daily, and duration of therapy varied from 3 weeks to 6 months. Statistically significant improvements after electrical stimulation therapy were recorded in one to four outcome measures in each of the studies: frequency of defecation, soiling, Bristol Stool Scale, radionuclear transit studies, and quality of life; however, the improvements were of modest degree and of uncertain clinical significance. Quality assessment of the studies found various levels of bias, with attrition bias and reporting bias in all six.
Conclusions: This systemic review found moderate support for the effectiveness of electrical stimulation therapy in slow transit constipation in children. However, better-designed studies, with larger and more diverse patient populations followed for longer time periods, will be needed in order to reliably determine the efficacy of electrical stimulation therapy in the treatment of this disorder."
65,Recommendations for pharmacological clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome: the Rome foundation pediatric subcommittee on clinical trials,Neurogastroenterol Motil,M Saps,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12896,"Background: There is little published evidence of efficacy for the most commonly used treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical trials on existing and novel therapies.
Purpose: In order to address these issues the Rome Foundation and members of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency formed a subcommittee on clinical trials to develop guidelines for the design of clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The following recommendations are based on evidence from published data when available and expert opinion.
Key recommendations: The subcommittee recommends randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs. The combined endpoints for abdominal pain are a decrease in intensity of at least 30% compared with baseline and to meet or exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the sample. Stool consistency is measured with the Bristol Stool Scale Form (BSFS). The subcommittee recommends as entry criteria for abdominal pain a weekly average of worst abdominal pain in past 24 h of at least 3.0 on a 0-10 point scale or at least 30 mm in 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. For stool endpoints the committee recommends an average stool consistency lower than 3 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-C and an average stool consistency greater than 5 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-D. Changes in stool consistency are the primary endpoints for both IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS with constipation (IBS-C)."

Methods: A comprehensive search for relevant studies published between January 1, 1951 and May 14, 2020 was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Web of Science, and EMbase. Two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. The software Endnote X9 was used for screening articles, and the Review Manager 5.3 for analyzing data.
Results: The meta-analyses involved 6 studies and 1457 individuals. The pooled results favored the EA group for the increase of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week in the fourth week (MD = 0.80, P = 0.001) during treatment, and further improved in the eight weeks (MD = 1.25, P < 0.001). During the follow-up period, significant changes in CSBMs per week were seen in the experimental group (MD = 1.38, P = 0.008); the effect decreased in the twelfth week (MD = 0.87, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the Bristol stool scale score between the two groups in the fourth week (MD = 0.40, P = 0.08), but significant differences were observed in the eighth week (MD = 0.40, P = 0.03). A significant reduction in patient assessment of constipation quality of life (PAC-QOL) score were observed in the EA group during treatment (SMD = -0.83, P < 0.001). No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions: EA had favorable effects on CSFC, and the longer the treatment duration was, the better was the effect, but the effect showed a certain period of validity. However, the results may be influenced by the clinical heterogeneity of acupuncture points, depth of needling, intensity, and frequency of EA."
67,Do stool form and frequency correlate with whole-gut and colonic transit? Results from a multicenter study in constipated individuals and healthy controls,Am J Gastroenterol,Richard J Saad,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.612,"Objectives: Despite a lack of supportive data, stool form and stool frequency are often used as clinical surrogates for gut transit in constipated patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between stool characteristics (form and frequency) and gut transit in constipated and healthy adults.
Methods: A post hoc analysis was performed on 110 subjects (46 chronic constipation) from nine US sites recording stool form (Bristol Stool Scale) and frequency during simultaneous assessment of whole-gut and colonic transit by wireless motility capsule (WMC) and radio-opaque marker (ROM) tests. Stool form and frequency were correlated with transit times using Spearman's rank correlation. Accuracy of stool form in predicting delayed transit was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Results: In the constipated adults (42 females, 4 males), moderate correlations were found between stool form and whole-gut transit measured by WMC (r=-0.61, P<0.0001) or ROM (-0.45, P=0.0016), as well as colonic transit measured by WMC (-0.62, P<0.0001). A Bristol stool form value <3 predicted delayed whole-gut transit with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 82% and delayed colonic transit with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 83%. No correlation between stool form and measured transit was found in healthy adults, regardless of gender. No correlation was found between stool frequency and measured transit in constipated or healthy adults. The correlation between stool frequency and measured transit remained poor in constipated adults with <3 bowel movements per week.
Conclusions: Stool form predicts delayed vs. normal transit in adults. However, only a moderate correlation exists between stool form and measured whole-gut or colonic transit time in constipated adults. In contrast, stool frequency is a poor surrogate for transit, even in those with reduced stool frequency."

The product was made from animal protein (beef) with the addition of vegetable oils, soy protein, maltodextrin, stabilizer, vitamins and minerals. 40 patients with gastrectomy were included to the study and randomly formed 2 groups of 20 persons: the main group (8 men and 12 women, mean age 64.4±12.4 years) on the background of standard mashed diet for 14 days received 2 portions of the tested product (240 ml), the control group (5 men and 15 women, mean age 64.8±12.9 years) was treated with standard diet. Daily registration of the symptoms was carried out filling the 5-point scale of the Likert (the presence and severity of abdominal pain, flatulence, heartburn, nausea, a feeling of heaviness after eating, incomplete evacuation of the intestine). The Bristol stool scale was used to assess the dynamics of the stool. Laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, blood serum level of total protein, albumin and iron) and body composition parameters were evaluated before and after treatment. Consumption of meat-containing canned food for enteral nutrition was accompanied by significant decrease in the severity of nausea (from 1.20±0.29 to 1.02±0.05 points of the Likert scale, p=0.017), a decrease in abdomen heaviness (from 1.8±0.8 to 1.4±0.6 points, p<0.05), contributed to an improvement in stool consistency, an increase in all body composition parameters, a positive dynamic of protein metabolism (increase of hemoglobin level from 119.2±9.6 to 122.6±6.8 g/l, p>0.05, blood serum protein and albumin). A tendency to increase the mental component of the quality of life (+4.2%) was found. Thus, meat-containing canned foods for enteral nutrition can be used in the diet of patients in the postoperative period, they are well tolerated in conditions with loss of appetite, are effective in patients with protein-energy malnutrition."

Thus, recommendations for the design of clinical trials in childhood FC are needed.
Purpose: Members of the Rome Foundation and a member of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency formed a committee to create recommendations for the design of clinical trials in children with FC.
Key recommendations: This committee recommends conducting randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs for the treatment of childhood FC. Pediatric study participants should be included based on fulfilling the Rome IV criteria for FC. A treatment free run-in period for baseline assessment is recommended. The trial duration should be at least 8 weeks. Treatment success is defined as no longer meeting the Rome IV criteria for FC. Stool consistency should be reported based on the Bristol Stool Scale. Endpoints of drug efficacy need to be tailored to the developmental age of the patient population."
70,Endoscopic and Histological Findings Are Predicted by Fecal Calprotectin in Acute Intestinal Graft-Versus-Host-Disease,Dig Dis Sci,Birgit Adam,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-016-4112-7,"Background: Gastrointestinal graft-versus-host-disease (GI-GVHD) is a major cause of nonrelapse mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) necessitating endoscopic examinations and biopsies for diagnosis. Fecal calprotectin (CPT) has been widely used in gastrointestinal inflammation, but comprehensive data in GI-GVHD are lacking.
Aims: We aimed to identify an association of CPT with endoscopic findings, mucosal damage and symptoms for diagnosing and monitoring acute GI-GVHD.
Methods: Symptoms were prospectively evaluated in 110 consecutive HSCT recipients by standardized questionnaires and Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). CPT was assayed by ELISA. Symptom assessment and CPT were performed weekly and with onset of first symptoms. GVHD was diagnosed according to the Glucksberg criteria and by endoscopic biopsies. Patients with GI-GVHD received standard high-dose corticosteroid therapy and follow-up CPT, and symptom evaluation was performed after 28 days. Patients not responding to steroid treatment were re-evaluated by colonoscopy.
Results: GI-GVHD was diagnosed in 40 patients. Twelve patients with GI symptoms and CMV colitis and 24 patients with isolated skin GVHD were included as control subjects. CPT was significantly higher in GI-GVHD compared to skin GVHD and CMV colitis. Endoscopic findings, histological grading, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, urgency and BSS correlated with CPT. At follow-up, CPT correlated with abdominal cramps, diarrhea, urgency and BSS. In steroid refractory patients, CPT level was still significantly associated with severity of mucosal damage.
Conclusion: CPT predicts endoscopic and histological findings in GI-GVHD and correlates with lower GI symptoms. It enables to discriminate GVHD from CMV colitis and to monitor therapeutic success."
71,Lubiprostone Accelerates Intestinal Transit and Alleviates Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Patients With Chronic Constipation,Am J Med Sci,Irene Sarosiek,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2016.05.012,"Background: Lubiprostone is an effective treatment for chronic constipation (CC). The mechanism of action of lubiprostone is through increasing fluid secretion and lubrication of the intestinal lumen. The effects of lubiprostone on gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) have not been adequately explored. The current study was designed to investigate whether lubiprostone (1) alters gastrointestinal transit and (2) affects SIBO in patients with constipation.
Methods: A total of 29 female patients (mean age = 39 years; range: 19-64) with CC received 2 weeks of lubiprostone (24mcg b.i.d., P.O.). Stool consistency based on Bristol stool scale and the frequency of bowel movements (BMs) were recorded. Gastric emptying time, small bowel transit time, colon transit time (CTT), combined small and large bowel transit time (SLBTT) and whole gut transit time were measured using wireless motility capsule. The SIBO status was assessed by the lactulose breath test. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman׳s rank correlation and Chi-square tests.
Results: Lubiprostone significantly softened the stool and increased the frequency of BM from median of 2 to 4times per week. The CTT and SLBTT were significantly shorter in responders to lubiprostone (i.e., those with ??2 times increase in the number of their weekly BM) compared with nonresponders. The higher frequency of BM after treatment was significantly correlated with the acceleration of CTT, SLBTT and whole gut transit time. In all, 17 out of 25 (68%) patients, who were tested for SIBO at baseline, were positive. In addition, 7 out of 17 (41%) SIBO-positive patients became SIBO-negative after lubiprostone treatment (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: In CC, lubiprostone improves the frequency of BMs, softens the stool, accelerates intestinal transit and decreases accompanying SIBO. The improvement of SIBO could be explained by the cleansing effect of increased intestinal fluid and mucus combined with enhanced intestinal motility with lubiprostone."
72,Epidemiology of slow and fast colonic transit using a scale of stool form in a community,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,R S Choung,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03456.x,"Background: Measurement of gastrointestinal transit is commonly performed in the clinic, but data on transit in the community are lacking.
Aim: To estimate the prevalence of slow and fast colonic transit using stool form, and potential risk factors.
Methods: A validated self-reported gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire was mailed to 4196 randomly selected members of the community (response rate 54%). One question asked the subject to self-report their stool form using the Bristol Stool Scale.
Results: Overall, 18%, 9% and 73% met stool form criteria for slow, fast or normal colonic transit, respectively. Increased odds for slow transit were observed with a higher Somatic Symptom Checklist score (OR = 1.6; 1.3-2.0), while a decreased odds for slow transit was observed in males relative to females (OR = 0.6; 0.5-0.8). An increased odds for fast transit was observed with higher Somatic Symptom Checklist score (OR = 2.3; 1.7-2.9) and a history of cholecystectomy (OR = 1.8; 1.2-2.8). Increasing body mass index (per 5 units) was associated with decreased odds for slow (OR = 0.85; 0.78-0.93), and an increased odds for fast (OR = 1.1; 1.04-1.24) colonic transit.
Conclusion: Based on stool form assessment, nearly one in five community members may have slow colonic transit and one in 12 have accelerated colonic transit."
73,Effectiveness of standing frame on constipation in children with cerebral palsy: a single-subject study,Occup Ther Int,Elena Rivi,https://doi.org/10.1002/oti.1370,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and quadriplegia or severe diplegia suffer from highly reduced mobility and consequent constipation. Clinicians recommend standing frames to exercise the support reaction in this population, sharing the opinion that the upright position may facilitate intestinal transit, although no evidence supports this assumption. We conducted this study to determine the effects of the standing frame on spontaneous evacuation in children with CP. Moreover, we studied its effects on the frequency of induction of evacuation, the characteristics of the stool and the pain suffered by the child due to constipation and/or evacuation. We implemented a single-subject research design in one chronically constipated child with CP and quadriplegia, Gross Motor Function Classification System Level V. To monitor the effects of the standing frame, we measured the outcome of interest throughout the study using a daily diary and the Bristol Stool Scale. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. This study has several limitation; primarily, the use of a single-subject research design only makes possible the visual analysis of data obtained from a unique patient. So, by themselves, data obtained do not allow us any generalization for the target population. Future research should verify our results collecting more data and also investigating the effect of the standing-frame on respiratory functions. Although the standing frame did not affect the frequency of evacuations or the characteristics of the stool, its employment reduced the inductions of evacuation and the related pain suffered by the child. However, this study has several limitations, such as the lack of generalization due to the fact that we studied a unique patient and the overall brevity of the study due to external circumstances. Therefore, we suggest future research to verify our results, also investigating the effect of the standing frame on respiratory functions. Relevance to clinical practice. The standing frame may positively influence the management of constipation of these children, possibly improving their quality of life."
74,Serum motilin levels and motilin gene polymorphisms in children with functional constipation,Minerva Pediatr,Emel Ulusoy,,"Background: Functional constipation is an important clinical problem among chidden all over the world. Its main cause is not completely understood. Motilin is a gastrointestinal hormone that increases intestinal motility. In this study, we aimed to investigate the serum motilin levels and its relationship with stool consistency and motilin gene polymorphisms in constipated children.
Methods: In this study we investigated 91 constipated patients (mean age 6.84 ± 3.55 years) and 100 healthy controls (mean age 7.78 ± 4.25 years). Serum motilin levels were assessed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. rs2281820 (c.44 C>T) and rs2281818 (c.66 C>T) mutations were evaluated for motilin gene polymorphisms.
Results: Serum motilin levels were significantly lower in constipated children than healthy controls (6.20 ± 7.86 pg/mL vs. 11.54 ± 17.89 pg/mL, respectively, p=0.008). Serum motilin levels were significantly correlated with Bristol stool scale rate (r = 0.193, p= 0.011) in whole study group, but in the constipation group there was no significant correlation (r= - 0.072, p= 0.528). There were no differences in terms of presence or distribution of the polymorphisms of rs2281820 (c.44 C>T) and rs2281818 (c.66 C>T) in both groups. There was not a significant difference between different polymorphism groups regarding serum motilin concentrations in whole study group and also in both of the study groups.
Conclusion: This study indicated for the first time that serum motilin levels decreased in constipated children. Further studies are needed to clarify whether motilin or motilin gene polymorphisms has a role in pathogenesis of functional constipation."
75,IBS patients show frequent fluctuations between loose/watery and hard/lumpy stools: implications for treatment,Am J Gastroenterol,Olafur S Palsson,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2011.358,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine how variable stool consistency is in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to assess the relationship between stool consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Methods: Individuals with a physician diagnosis of IBS were recruited by advertisement. Enrollment questionnaires included the Rome III Diagnostic Questionnaire and IBS Symptom Severity Scale. Then, 185 patients meeting the Rome criteria for IBS rated the consistency (using the Bristol Stool Scale) of each bowel movement (BM) for 90 days and whether the BM was accompanied by pain, urgency, or soiling. Each night, they transferred BM ratings from a paper diary to an internet form and also reported the average daily intensity of abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit dissatisfaction, and life interference of bowel symptoms. Only the longest sequence of consecutive days of diary data was used in the analysis (average of 73 days).
Results: Patients were 89% females with average age 36.6 years. Among the patients, 78% had both loose/watery and hard/lumpy stools; the average was three fluctuations between these extremes per month. The proportion of loose/watery stools correlated r=0.78 between the first and second months and the proportion of hard/lumpy stools correlated r=0.85 between months. Loose/watery stools were associated with more BM-related pain, urgency, and soiling than hard/lumpy or normal stools; however, IBS-C patients had significantly more BM-unrelated abdominal pain, bloating, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and life interference than IBS-D patients. Questionnaires overestimated the frequency of abnormal stool consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms compared with diaries.
Conclusions: Stool consistency varies greatly within individuals. However, stool patterns are stable within an individual from month to month. The paradoxical findings of greater symptom severity after individual loose/watery BMs vs. greater overall symptom severity in IBS-C implies different physiological mechanisms for symptoms in constipation compared with diarrhea. Daily symptom monitoring is more sensitive and reliable than a questionnaire."
76,[Dry jelly concentrate with vitamins and dietary fiber in patients with IBS with constipation: a comparative controlled study],Vopr Pitan,V I Pilipenko,,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with decrease in quality of life and a high social cost. Diet is one of several therapeutic options in IBS treatment; therefore the development and clinical evaluation of innovative functional food for IBS patients is useful. Dry jelly concentrate containing 3 g inulin, 10 mg curcumin and 1.8 mg of pyridoxine was developed and clinically evaluated. Fifty patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS-C were randomly assigned into two groups: one received standard diet plus two jelly drinks a day for 2 weeks and control group received standard diet. Response to therapy was recorded on a daily basis using Likert scale of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete bowel emptying, frequency of bowel movement, Bristol stool scale, and quality of life assessed by IBSQoL questionnaire before and after the treatment. Intake of functional food product (jelly) containing inulin and curcumin is associated with a significant positive effect on the stool parameters (from 0.6±0.24 to 1.15±0.65 t/d in stool frequency, p=0.001, from 2.62±1.23 to 3.99±1.27, index Bristol scale, p=0.001), a reduce of the severity of abdominal pain (from 1.69±0.71 to 1.36±0.44 Likert scale points, p=0.001), bloating (from 2.03±0.89 to 1.55±0.81 points of Likert scale, p=0.02) and a sense of incomplete bowel emptying (from 2.25±0.98 to 1.68±0.92 points of Likert scale, p=0.001), as well as an increase in quality of life (from 64.5±13.5 to 81.2±9.1%, ?=0.05). Patients in control group have improvement in abdominal pain (from 2.16±0.58 to 1.8±0.61 Likert scale points, p=0.05) and bloating (from 2.42±0.83 to 2.16±0.71 Likert scale points, p=0.05) only. During the treatment period no significant adverse events were found. These results indicate that jelly concentrate containing inulin, curcumin and pyridoxine improves abdominal pain score, Bristol scale index and quality of life in patients with IBS-C."
77,Efficacy of double-coated probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized double-blind controlled trial,J Gastroenterol,Kyungsun Han,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-016-1224-y,"Background: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of a dual-coated probiotic supplement (Duolac Care) on symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a randomized double-blind clinical trial.
Methods: Fifty subjects with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to either the non-coating group or the dual-coating group in order to receive two capsules per day of multi-species probiotics containing 5 billion bacteria per capsule for 4 weeks. Data from an adequate relief questionnaire were used in assessment of primary outcome. Daily records of stool frequencies and the Bristol stool scale, a weekly symptom diary using 100-mm visual analog scale, and Beck depression inventories were collected. Blood tests including blood cell counts, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and regulatory T cells-CD4 + CD25high T cells, CD4 + LAP + T cells and CD25high + LAP + T cells-were analyzed before and after the study. The shift of gut microbiota was investigated using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
Results: Responses to the adequate relief questionnaire indicated significant improvement in overall discomfort in the dual-coating group and the ratio of normal stools to hard or watery stools had a better effect from dual-coated probiotics compared to non-coated probiotics. This may be due to a shift of intestinal microbiota, as our correlation analysis showed significant negative correlation between Bifidobacterium and urgency of defecation.
Conclusions: Our result implies that dual-coating layers of probiotic supplement can be a candidate for treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome."
78,Chronic functional constipation in children: adherence and factors associated with drug treatment,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Scilvia A Steiner,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000000255,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the treatment adherence of children with chronic functional constipation.
Methods: The present study is a prospective and longitudinal study realized at a pediatric gastroenterology clinic of a Brazilian University Hospital, between August 2009 and October 2011. Rome III criteria and the Bristol Stool Scale were used to define constipation and to characterize feces, respectively. Drug treatment was prescribed for patients according to the protocols previously standardized in the clinic. Specific questionnaires, containing questions related to 1 dependent variable and independent variables were completed in the first and sixth months of the treatment. Independent variables related to the patients, their caregivers, the disease itself, and the therapeutic plan were analyzed and compared with the dependent variable (adherence to the treatment). Adherence was considered when the patient returned with >75% of the prescribed medicine containers empty.
Results: Fifty children participated in both the first and sixth months of treatment. The mean age of the sample was 77.6 ± 43.8 months and the mean age of the onset of symptoms was 18.8 ± 27.9 months. The adherence rate was 38% in the first month and 30% in the sixth month. Patients who were treated with polyethylene glycol had greater adherence than patients who were prescribed other laxatives, with statistical significance in the second moment of the study (P = 0.19 and P = 0.04, respectively).
Conclusions: The study showed low adherence rates to drug treatment of constipation in children. It is necessary to seek new strategies to increase treatment adherence, while avoiding complications and reducing costs."
79,"A prospective, interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bacillus coagulans LBSC in the treatment of acute diarrhea with abdominal discomfort",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,Chiranjit Maity,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-018-2562-x,"Purpose: Increasing resistance towards antibiotics has augmented the use of probiotics for the treatment of diarrhea and associated symptoms. Probiotics are active microorganisms which exert some health benefits when consumed in the right amount. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 ""intention to treat"" subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of probiotic preparation Lactic Acid Bacillus (LAB containing active ingredient Bacillus coagulans strain LBSC) for the treatment of acute diarrhea with abdominal discomfort.
Methods: The Test-A arm (n = 30) was on B. coagulans LBSC [2 billion/g] and Placebo-B arm (n = 30) was on the carrier. The primary outcomes were the time to last unformed stool (TTLUS), number of unformed stools, change in severity of abdominal pain, time to complete resolution of abdominal discomfort, complete remission of diarrhea, and quality of life (QoL). The secondary outcomes were physical examination and vitals, hematological analysis, and assessment of reported adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).
Results: Trial data showed that the LAB was well-tolerated by participants at the dose provided. The LAB was effective in recovering from acute diarrhea with abdominal pain and discomforts and exhibited improved cluster of QoL. No AEs or SAEs were reported during the trial.
Conclusions: It is evident that the test drug, i.e., LAB (B. coagulans strain LBSC) is safe and effective for improving the pathophysiological conditions related to acute diarrhea and abdominal discomfort evaluated through stage-II clinical trial."
80,Partially hydrolyzed guar gum in pediatric functional abdominal pain,World J Gastroenterol,Claudio Romano,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v19.i2.235,"Aim: To assess the effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) diet supplement in pediatric chronic abdominal pain (CAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Methods: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in sixty children (8-16 years) with functional bowel disorders, such as CAP or IBS, diagnosed according to Rome III criteria. All patients underwent ultrasound, blood and stool examinations to rule out any organic disease. Patients were allocated to receive PHGG at dosage of 5 g/d (n = 30) or placebo (fruit-juice n = 30) for 4 wk. The evaluation of the efficacy of fiber supplement included IBS symptom severity score (Birmingham IBS Questionnaire), severity of abdominal pain (Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score) and bowel habit (Bristol Stool Scale). Symptom scores were completed at 2, 4, and 8 wk. The change from baseline in the symptom severity scale at the end of treatment and at 4 wk follow-up after treatment was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate compliance to supplementation with the PHGG in the pediatric population. Differences within groups during the treatment period and follow-up were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results: The results of the study were assessed considering some variables, such as frequency and intensity of symptoms with modifications of the bowel habit. Both groups were balanced for baseline characteristics and all patients completed the study. Group A (PHGG group) presented a higher level of efficacy compared to group B (control group), (43% vs 5%, P = 0.025) in reducing clinical symptoms with modification of Birmingham IBS score (median 0 ± 1 vs 4 ± 1, P = 0.025), in intensity of CAP assessed with the Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score and in normalization of bowel habit evaluated with the Bristol Stool Scale (40% vs 13.3%, P = 0.025). In IBS subgroups, statistical analysis shown a tendency toward normalization of bowel movements, but there was no difference in the prevalence of improvement in two bowel habit subsets. PHGG was therefore better tolerated without any adverse effects.
Conclusion: Although the cause of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders is not known, the results show that complementary therapy with PHGG may have beneficial effects on symptom control."
81,Influence of a probiotic mixture on antibiotic induced microbiota disturbances,World J Gastroenterol,Sofia Forssten,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11878,"Aim: To study the effect of probiotic consumption on the faecal microbiota during and after antibiotic exposure.
Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a two species probiotic combination [Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) ATCC 700396 and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) ATCC SD5220] on healthy adults during and after antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin 875 and 125 mg clavulanate). The dominant faecal microbiota was studied by real time-polymerase chain reaction to determine if this probiotic preparation could facilitate restoring the microbiota to its pre-antibiotic state and influence the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by questionnaire and Bristol stool scale.
Results: Subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at day 8 (end of antibiotic treatment period) vs those on placebo. Furthermore, subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at Day 15 (end of probiotic treatment) vs those on placebo. Lactobacillus counts remained stable in the probiotic group over the course of the study, while Clostridium XIV group was higher at the end of the study and closer to baseline levels; this in contrast to the placebo group. Beta-lactam resistance in creased after antibiotic exposure and was not different between both treatment groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms were generally mild and did not differ between the treatment groups, which correlates with the generally small changes in the microbiota.
Conclusion: Consumption of the probiotic combination mainly leads to an increase in the faecal levels of the species included in the preparation."
82,Diagnosis of constipation in family practice,Can J Gastroenterol,Simon Ferrazzi,https://doi.org/10.1155/2002/740413,"Background: Patients who complain of constipation to their family doctor may not be truly constipated. Variability in stool frequency and consistency, and perception of symptoms may lead to inaccurate patient reporting or diagnosis of constipation.
Objectives: To determine whether patients visiting their family doctor with a complaint of, or diagnosed with, constipation fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional constipation and had stool characteristics of constipation.
Methods: A random sample of Canadian family physicians were recruited to enroll a series of adults who complained of, or had received a diagnosis of, constipation during an office visit. Patients were advised of the survey. Those providing written consent were contacted by an independent research firm and forwarded a survey questionnaire that included the Rome II gastrointestinal questionnaire, questions regarding their medical history and questions regarding their demographics. Patients also completed a four-week daily diary recording their bowel habits using the Bristol Stool Form Scale, medication use and satisfaction with treatment. Questionnaire and diary responses were retrieved by telephone.
Results: One hundred eighty-four family physicians enrolled 311 patients, of whom 220 completed the questionnaire. Females comprised 79.5% of the sample and had a mean age of 54.2 years (males 61.6 years; P<0.05). According to the Rome II criteria, 37.3% had functional constipation and 46.8% had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whole gut transit times estimated using the Bristol Stool Scale were similar among those with self-reported constipation, those with Rome II functional constipation and those with Rome II IBS (79.3 h, 85.8 h and 77.4 h, respectively). Almost half of the patients with IBS or functional constipation were taking a pain medication, while nearly one-fifth took antidepressants. Of the medications or remedies taken to treat constipation, patients rated 49.8% of the doses as satisfactory.
Conclusions: A large proportion of Canadian primary care patients whose presenting complaint or diagnosis was constipation satisfied the Rome II criteria for IBS, with a smaller number defined as functionally constipated. IBS patients tended to be younger than those with functional constipation, and whole gut transit times did not differentiate IBS from functional constipation. Careful questioning of patients who complain of constipation may reveal constipating medication, diarrhea symptoms or IBS."

Methods: Participants received twice-daily 100 mg docusate sodium and were randomized to daily 1) PEG3350 or 2) inert placebo for 5 days after urogynecologic surgery. They completed bowel diaries, Bristol stool scale, validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire, and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality-of-Life Questionnaire preoperatively and 1 week after surgery. Our primary outcome was time to first bowel movement after surgery. To detect a 1-day difference in time to first bowel movement (4 compared with 3 days), 63 participants were needed in each group.
Results: From September 2012 through March 2015, 145 women were randomized and 131 (90%) analyzed: 66 received PEG3350, and 65 received placebo. Polyethylene glycol 3350 did not significantly reduce time to first bowel movement after surgery compared with placebo (2.77 days [interquartile range 1.86-3.40] compared with 2.92 days [interquartile range 1.85-4.02] P=.25). Women in the PEG3350 group were less likely to take additional laxatives postoperatively, and the PEG3350 group was more adherent to the study drug regimen. Questionnaire scores, fecal incontinence, and urgency were similar between groups.
Conclusion: In women taking routine docusate sodium after urogynecologic surgery, adding PEG3350 postoperatively did not reduce time to first bowel movement.

An initial medical history and physical examination can provide relevant clues to the causes of the problem. The Rome III classification system of functional constipation is useful in clinical practice to help clinicians identify symptoms and confirm a diagnosis. Additionally, the Bristol Stool Scale is a valuable medical aid designed to assist patients in describing bowel patterns in a way that is more useful for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment methods. Pharmacological management, along with dietary changes and patient education, is the initial approach to treat patients with idiopathic chronic constipation. Consensus statements support a five-step care approach for patients with constipation. Knowledge of this approach will help clinicians in prescribing the appropriate medications along with patient education."

Objective: In the present study, we determined whether commercial heat-treated MFGM can increase resistance to diarrheagenic Escherichia coli.
Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 4-wk parallel-intervention study was conducted in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to a milk protein concentrate rich in MFGM [10 g Lacprodan PL-20 (Arla Foods Ingredients Group P/S), twice daily; n = 30; MFGM group) or a control [10 g Miprodan 30 (sodium caseinate), twice daily; n = 28]. After 2 wk, participants were orally challenged with live, attenuated diarrheagenic E. coli (10(10) colony-forming units). Primary outcomes were infection-induced diarrhea and fecal diarrheagenic E. coli excretion. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms [Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)], stool frequency, and stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale).
Results: Diarrheagenic E. coli resulted in increased fecal output, lower relative fecal dry weight, increased fecal E. coli numbers, and an increase in stool frequency and gastrointestinal complaints at day 1 after challenge. MFGM significantly decreased the E. coli-induced changes in reported stool frequency (1.1 ± 0.1 stools/d in the MFGM group; 1.6 ± 0.2 stools/d in the control group; P = 0.04) and gastrointestinal complaints at day 2 (1.1 ± 0.5 and 2.5 ± 0.6 GSRS scores in the MFGM and control groups, respectively; P = 0.05). MFGM did not affect fecal wet weight and E. coli excretion at day 2 after challenge.
Conclusions: The attenuated diarrheagenic E. coli strain transiently induced mild symptoms of a food-borne infection, with complete recovery of reported clinical symptoms within 2 d. The present diarrheagenic E. coli challenge trial conducted in healthy adults indicates that a milk concentrate rich in natural, bioactive phospho- and sphingolipids from the MFGM may improve in vivo resistance to diarrheagenic E. coli. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01800396."

Methods: Sixty-four patients with myelopathy due to extradural spine pathologies (47 cervical; 17 thoracic spine, male:female-5.4:1 with mean age 46.16) underwent evaluation including Bristol stool scale (BSS), PFT and uroflowmetry. All cases were evaluated by gastroenterologist to rule out any intrinsic bowel disease. Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were employed to ascertain statistical significance.
Results: The presence of constipation was associated with male sex (p = 0.01), degree of constipation with duration bladder symptoms (p = 0.008) and numbness (p = 0.04). The improvement in BSS after surgery (p = 0.006) was associated with local pain (p = 0.02), duration of weakness (p = 0.04) and overall symptoms (p = 0.01), also with pulmonary function tests (p = 0.002) and pre-operative Nurick's grade (p = 0.01).
Conclusion: Constipation is a myelopathic symptom as it is relieved by cord decompression and the gender, PFT and the duration of symptoms play an important role in defining constipation and expected improvement in these patients."

In the present paper, we evaluate a protein preparation containing these components in comparison with placebo in adult patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS.
Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre clinical trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive the combination of oligo- and polysaccharides and reticulated protein and placebo (four oral tablets/day for 56 days). Demographic, clinical and quality of life characteristics and presence and intensity of abdominal pain and flatulence (seven-point Likert scale) were assessed at three study visits (baseline and at 28 and 56 days). Stool emissions were recorded on the diary card using the seven-point Bristol Stool Scale.
Results: A total of 128 patients were randomised to receive either tablets containing the combination (n = 63) or placebo (n = 65). Treatment with oligo- and polysaccharides and reticulated protein was safe and well tolerated. A significant improvement in symptoms across the study was observed in patients treated with oligo- and polysaccharides and reticulated protein between visit 2 and visit 3 in abdominal pain (p = 0.0167) and flatulence (p = 0.0373). We also detected a statistically significant increase in the quality of life of patients receiving the active treatment from baseline to visit 3 (p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: Treatment with oligo- and polysaccharides and reticulated protein is safe, improving IBS symptoms and quality of life of patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS."
88,Lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation in human subjects and their resistance to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection,Br J Nutr,A C Ouwehand,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114513002547,"To assess the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 700396) on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection, in the present study, a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males. The subjects largely consumed their habitual diet, but had to abstain from consuming dairy foods generally high in Ca. The subjects were randomised into the L. acidophilus (dose 10??colony-forming units twice daily; n 20) or the placebo (n 19) group. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the subjects were orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine, able to induce mild, short-lived symptoms. Before and after the challenge, the subjects recorded stool consistency, bowel habits, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. The ETEC challenge led to a significant increase in faecal output on the 2nd day and a concomitant increase in Bristol stool scale scores. Likewise, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, fever, headache and nausea peaked 1 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of faecal calprotectin and IgA peaked 2 d after and that of serum IgM peaked 9 and 15 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of serum IgA and IgG were unaffected. The ETEC challenge led to a reduction in the number of Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVab and total faecal bacteria. Probiotic treatment was associated with a larger increase in Bristol stool scale scores and more fever, headache and nausea after the ETEC challenge compared with the placebo treatment. These differences were, however, small and with substantial variation within the groups. Oral application of an attenuated live ETEC vaccine provides a useful model for food-borne infections. Supplementation with L. acidophilus ATCC 700396, however, was ineffective in reducing ETEC infection symptoms in healthy men."
89,[Safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes for the treatment of functional constipation in children],An Pediatr (Barc),D Infante Pina,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.01.021,"Introduction: Polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG+E) efficacy has been validated in some studies, but not many have evaluated its safety in children. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety; renal, malabsorption or excessive production of gas and efficacy of PEG+E treatment in our paediatric population.
Patients and methods: Fifteen patients who suffered functional constipation (Rome III criteria) were evaluated. Median age was 6.2 years (r 2-9). All patients had normal renal function. PEG+E were administered for 4 weeks (4WP). The mean dose was 0.44 g/kg/day, titrated according to age, weight and response. Urine screens (sodium and osmolality) were performed at the beginning and 4WP. Stool sample NIRA (near-infrared reflectance analysis) and hydrogen breath test analysis samples were performed at 4WP. To analyse the efficacy of the treatment, the number of stools per week and stool form type (Bristol stool scale) were recorded.
Results: The number of stools per week was higher after 4 weeks (2.46 ± 0.71 vs 5.29 ± 1.68, P<.001), as well as the stool form score (2.47 ± 1.24 vs 4.5 ± 0.91, P<.001). No statistical differences were obtained between urine sodium and urine osmolality values at the beginning and 4WP. After 4WP the NIRA median values were normal in all patients [fat 4.45% (range (r) 3.6-7.09); nitrogen 0.78% (r 0.4-1); sugars 1.4% (r 0.47-2.35) and water 68% (r 59-74)]. Median breath hydrogen test was 7 ppm (r 2-18).
Conclusions: No adverse effects on biochemistry values or gastrointestinal disturbances were observed. PEG+E can be recommended for the treatment of functional constipation in children."

Patients refractory to standard anti-diarrhetics have limited treatment options. Somatostatin analogues have the ability to reduce gastrointestinal secretions and motility. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lanreotide Autogel(*) 120 mg in chronic idiopathic diarrhea.
Methods: Other anti-diarrhetics were not allowed during the study and were stopped at screening. Patients received lanreotide Autogel 120 mg at baseline and day 28. Stool frequency and consistency (Bristol Stool Scale) were recorded; quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and irritable bowel syndrome QoL questionnaires; adverse events were monitored. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a reduction of ??0% or normalization to a mean of ?? stools/d at day 28.
Findings: Thirty-three patients with >3 stools/d at baseline were included; mean (SD) age was 55.2 (16.4) years. Fourteen patients (42.4%) had a response to lanreotide Autogel at day 28 and 17 (51.5%) at day 56. Mean (SD) number of stools decreased significantly from 5.7 (2.2) at baseline to 3.7 (2.2) at day 56 overall (n = 32; P < 0.001). Significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease-specific QoL were found in the overall populations. No new safety signals emerged.
Implications: Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg decreased symptoms in these patients with chronic idiopathic refractory diarrhea, and meaningfully improved QoL. These finding have to be confirmed in further clinical trials. ClinicalTrials.gov

91,Constipation and defecation pattern the first 30 days after thoracic surgery,Scand J Caring Sci,Lene Sch?tt Rasmussen,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6712.2009.00713.x,"Introduction: In clinical practice constipation is often an overlooked aspect of patient care and first gains attention when it has become a severe problem for the patients. Constipation increases the risk for postoperative complications, can prolong hospital stay, increase financial cost, and staff nursing care time.
Material and method: A prospective descriptive design was used. One hundred and thirty nine patients participated in the study from February to June 2006. On admission, day of discharge, and 30 days after surgery patients normal and actual defecation pattern, stool consistency, and if they experienced problems with defecation was assessed by a structured interview. North America Nursing Diagnosis Associations (NANDA's) general definition of constipation was used as a frame of reference for this study. The Bristol Stool Scale was used to measure stool consistency. Prolonged and difficult evacuation and defecation pattern was recorded on a self-composed scale.
Results: Fifty per cent of patients developed constipation during the first postoperative period and their normal pattern of defecation was re-established 17 days after discharge. Nearly one third of the patients reported that their daily life was affected by constipation after discharge.
Conclusion: The results imply that further studies are needed to prevent constipation and to help patients to cope with this side effect of surgery after discharge. The results of this study also suggest that acute and chronic constipation might be two different disorders."
92,Lubiprostone for constipation in adults with cystic fibrosis: a pilot study,Ann Pharmacother,Catherine E O'Brien,https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1q219,"Background: Constipation is prevalent in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population and yet there are few data demonstrating the effectiveness of currently used treatments. Lubiprostone is a laxative that works by activating the type 2 chloride channel in the gastrointestinal tract and thus has the potential to be especially effective for constipation associated with CF.
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of lubiprostone for the treatment of constipation in adults with CF.
Methods: In this pilot study, participants acted as their own controls and comparisons were made between run-in and treatment periods. During the 2-week run-in period, participants continued their usual treatment for constipation; during the 4-week treatment period, participants received lubiprostone 24 μg twice daily. Efficacy outcomes included spontaneous bowel movement frequency, Bristol Stool Scale scores, and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) survey scores. Outcomes were assessed during both the run-in and treatment periods (0, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment). Safety outcomes included spirometry, body weight, and serum chemistry.
Results: Seven participants completed the study. Mean (SD) baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 83.0% (9.4) of predicted and body mass index was 24.0 (2.8) kg/m², indicating an overall healthy, well-nourished group of adults with CF. Lubiprostone improved overall symptoms of constipation as measured by PAC-SYM survey scores (1.18 [0.56], 0.54 [0.27], and 0.44 [0.36] at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, respectively; p < 0.001). Spontaneous bowel movement frequency and Bristol Stool Scale scores were not statistically significantly different between periods. There were no differences in safety measures. Transient chest tightness and shortness of breath were reported by 2 separate participants, although neither participant withdrew due to these adverse effects.
Conclusions: Lubiprostone may be an effective option for the treatment of constipation in adults with CF."
93,Importance of diarrhea in evaluating constipation in irritable bowel syndrome clinical studies,J Clin Gastroenterol,Robert J Basseri,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0b013e3182053cea,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by alterations in bowel function, abdominal discomfort, and bloating. The symptoms of IBS vary widely between constipation and diarrhea predominance. In this study, we examine ""constipation minus diarrhea"" score (C-D) to account for the contribution of diarrhea and to create a reliable method for predicting constipation predominance in IBS.
Methods: A nested study was conducted in participants with IBS by Rome I criteria. After consent, they completed a daily stool diary for 1 week. This included recording frequency of bowel movements and describing consistency of stool using the Bristol stool scale. After submitting their diaries, participants rated their bowel symptoms using a visual analog score (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, with 100 mm representing maximum severity. VAS scores for C, D, and C-D were subsequently compared with the true stool events of the previous week by stool diary to validate the potential usefulness of the simple C-D method.
Results: Eighty-four participants with IBS completed stool diaries and VAS surveys for bowel symptoms, from which C-D scores were compiled. By correcting for the predominance of constipation compared with diarrhea, C-D scores predicted constipation based on the frequency of bowel movements and Bristol stool score. Furthermore, a second method was used to validate the C-D technique by comparing the mean C-D score in participants with constipation (?? d with bowel movement in previous week). In this case, the mean C-D score was 74.1 ± 3.8 compared with -3.0 ± 5.9 for patients with >3 days with bowel movement in that week (P<0.001). Although the constipation severity alone also distinguished these 2 groups, the difference was less impressive (P<0.01). In participants with mean Bristol stool scores of ?? in the preceding week, the C-D mean score was 25.4 ± 6.1 compared with participants having mean Bristol stool score of >2 where the C-D was -11.1 ± 5.9 (P<0.01). Using constipation severity by VAS alone, there was no significant difference between these same 2 Bristol stool categories (P=0.29).
Conclusions: IBS patients' self-assessment of constipation and diarrhea severity using the C-D score is an effective predictor of C-IBS and constipation severity. The C-D score may be a useful tool in future IBS constipation trials, as it seems to predict constipation and it correlates well with stool diaries."
94,Are characteristics of abdominal pain helpful to identify patients with visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome? Results of a prospective study,Neurogastroenterol Motil,C Melchior,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13290,"Background: Some consider that patients with visceral hypersensitivity may represent a separate entity within the IBS population not only from a pathophysiological but also from a clinical perspective. The aim of this prospective exploratory study was to assess whether characteristics of abdominal pain in IBS patients could be suggestive of hypersensitivity.
Methods: This prospective study included consecutive IBS patients selected by Rome III criteria. Validated scores (IBS-SSS, Bristol stool scale, HADS) were used to phenotype patients who were also asked to describe the main location of their abdominal pain on a simple image (abdomen divided into 6 zones). Progressive isobaric rectal distensions were performed to demonstrate, with the ascending method of limits, allodynia (pain threshold lower than 24 mmHg).
Key results: Fifty patients (women: 72%), 42.6 ± 15.7 years old, were included. Sub-types were IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M in 58%, 22% and 20% of cases, respectively. Allodynia was present in 18% of cases. Neither IBS-SSS nor intensity of pain was predictive of hypersensitivity. In hypersensitive patients, pain was more often located in one of the two iliac fossa (P = 0.02) and located outside these areas in only 11% of cases. The sensitivity and the specificity of this pain location to differentiate hyper from normosensitive patients were 0.89 and 0.59, respectively.
Conclusions & inferences: The location of pain is different between hyper and normosensitive IBS patients. Pain located outside one of the two iliac fossa suggests that the patient is normosensitive."
95,Eluxadoline benefits patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in a phase 2 study,Gastroenterology,Leonard S Dove,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.006,"Background & aims: Simultaneous agonism of the μ-opioid receptor and antagonism of the δ-opioid receptor can reduce abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) without constipating side effects. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a minimally absorbed, μ-opioid receptor agonist and δ-opioid receptor antagonist (eluxadoline) in a phase 2 study in patients with IBS-D.
Methods: We randomly assigned 807 patients to groups that received oral placebo twice daily or 5, 25, 100, or 200 mg oral eluxadoline for 12 weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4, defined by a mean reduction in daily pain score from baseline of ??30%, and of at least 2 points on 0-10 scale, as well as a stool consistency score of 3 or 4 on the Bristol Stool Scale (1-7) for at least 66% of daily diary entries during that week.
Results: Significantly more patients receiving 25 mg (12.0%) or 200 mg (13.8%) eluxadoline met the primary end point of clinical response than patients given placebo (5.7%; P < .05). Patients receiving eluxadoline at 100 mg and 200 mg also had greater improvements in bowel movement frequency and urgency, global symptoms, quality of life, and adequate relief assessments (P < .05). Additionally, patients receiving 100 mg (28.0%) or 200 mg (28.5%) eluxadoline were significantly more likely than those receiving placebo (13.8%; P < .005) to meet the US Food and Drug Administration response end point during the full 12 weeks of the study. Eluxadoline was well tolerated with a low incidence of constipation.
Conclusions: In a phase 2 study of the mixed μ-opioid receptor agonist/δ-opioid receptor antagonist eluxadoline vs placebo in patients with IBS-D, patients given eluxadoline were significantly more likely to be clinical responders, based on a composite of improvement in abdominal pain and stool consistency. Further study of eluxadoline is warranted to assess its potential as a treatment for IBS-D."
96,The Importance of Objective Stool Classification in Fecal 1H-NMR Metabolomics: Exponential Increase in Stool Crosslinking Is Mirrored in Systemic Inflammation and Associated to Fecal Acetate and Methionine,Metabolites,Leon Deutsch,https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo11030172,"Past studies strongly connected stool consistency-as measured by Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)-with microbial gene richness and intestinal inflammation, colonic transit time and metabolome characteristics that are of clinical relevance in numerous gastro intestinal conditions. While retention time, defecation rate, BSS but not water activity have been shown to account for BSS-associated inflammatory effects, the potential correlation with the strength of a gel in the context of intestinal forces, abrasion, mucus imprinting, fecal pore clogging remains unexplored as a shaping factor for intestinal inflammation and has yet to be determined. Our study introduced a minimal pressure approach (MP) by probe indentation as measure of stool material crosslinking in fecal samples. Results reported here were obtained from 170 samples collected in two independent projects, including males and females, covering a wide span of moisture contents and BSS. MP values increased exponentially with increasing consistency (i.e., lower BSS) and enabled stratification of samples exhibiting mixed BSS classes. A trade-off between lowest MP and highest dry matter content delineated the span of intermediate healthy density of gel crosslinks. The crossectional transects identified fecal surface layers with exceptionally high MP and of <5 mm thickness followed by internal structures with an order of magnitude lower MP, characteristic of healthy stool consistency. The MP and BSS values reported in this study were coupled to reanalysis of the PlanHab data and fecal 1H-NMR metabolomes reported before. The exponential association between stool consistency and MP determined in this study was mirrored in the elevated intestinal and also systemic inflammation and other detrimental physiological deconditioning effects observed in the PlanHab participants reported before. The MP approach described in this study can be used to better understand fecal hardness and its relationships to human health as it provides a simple, fine scale and objective stool classification approach for the characterization of the exact sampling locations in future microbiome and metabolome studies."

The aim of this pilot study was to present the results of TAI using the Peristeen(®) TAI system in a group of paediatric patients with anorectal malformation (ARM) and congenital or acquired spinal cord lesions (SCLs).
Method: Eight Italian paediatric surgery and spina bifida centres participated in the study. The inclusion criteria were age between 6 and 17 years, weight above 20 kg and unsatisfactory bowel management. Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, mental disability and surgery within the previous 3 months were excluded. At the beginning of treatment (T0) and after 3 months (T1) the Bristol scale, a questionnaire assessing bowel function, and two questionnaires on quality of life (QoL) for patients aged 6-11 years (CHQ-pf50) and 12-17 years (SF36) were administered.
Results: Eighty-three patients were enrolled, and seventy-eight completed the study (41 ARMs, 37 SCLs). At T1, constipation was reduced in ARMs from 69% to 25.6% and in SCLs from 92.7% to 41.5%, faecal incontinence in ARMs from 50% to 18.6% and in SCLs from 39% to 9.8% and flatus incontinence in ARMs from 20.9% to 9.8% and in SCLs from 31.7% to 10%. At T0, the Bristol Stool Scale types were 1-2 in 45% of ARMs and 77.5% of SCL patients, whereas at T1 types 1-2 were recorded in only 2.5% of SCL patients. QoL improved in both groups. In the younger group, a significant improvement in QoL was recorded in ARM patients for eight of nine variables and in SCL patients for seven of nine variables.
Conclusion: This study showed that Peristeen TAI resulted in a significant time reduction in colonic cleansing, increased independence from the carer and improved QoL in paediatric patients with ARMs and SCLs."

Therefore, we report the protocol of a randomized controlled trial of using acupuncture to treat functional constipation.
Design: A randomized, controlled, four-arm design, large-scale trial is currently undergoing in China. Seven hundred participants are randomly assigned to three acupuncture treatment groups and Mosapride Citrate control group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Participants in acupuncture groups receive 16 sessions of acupuncture treatment, and are followed up for a period of 9 weeks after randomization. The acupuncture groups are: (1) Back-Shu and Front-Mu acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu points group); (2) He-Sea and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (He points group); (3) Combining used Back-Shu, Front-Mu, He-Sea, and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu-He points group). The control group is Mosapride Citrate group. The primary outcome is frequency of defecation per week at the fourth week after randomization. The secondary outcomes include Bristol stool scale, the extent of difficulty during defecating, MOS 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The first two of second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after randomization. Other second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2 and 4 weeks after randomization, but SF-36 is measured at randomization and 4 weeks after randomization.
Discussion: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2012) will confirm whether acupuncture is effective to treat functional constipation and whether traditional acupuncture theories play an important role in it.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between changes in the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among patients with OIC treated with naloxegol.
Methods: Post hoc analyses were conducted using pooled data from two Phase III 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of naloxegol for the treatment of OIC (NCT01309841 and NCT01323790). Patients completed the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) and PAC-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) at each study visit, and the Straining Scale and Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) with each bowel movement for the study duration. Four subgroups were created based on improvements from baseline in mean frequency of SBMs per week: 0 or worse (no change), +1 SBM, +2 SBMs, and +?? SBMs. Spearman correlations assessed the association between mean SBM changes from baseline and mean changes from baseline in PROs; analysis of covariance was used to compare changes from baseline.
Findings: A total of 1337 patients with mean (SD) age of 52.2 (11.0) years were included in this analysis. The patient population was predominantly white (79.0%) and female (62.4%). At baseline, mean SBM frequency was 1.4 (1.0) per week. At study end, all 4 SBM-change subgroups experienced improvements in PAC-QOL, PAC-SYM, Straining Scale, and BSS scores, and these changes were significantly correlated with mean changes from baseline in SBMs per week. The subgroup of patients with an increase in SBMs of ?? per week experienced the greatest improvements in PROs.
Implications: In these patients with OIC, an improvement in the frequency of SBMs by ?? per week was associated with consistent improvements in PROs, providing support for the use of improvements in SBMs as a clinical outcome surrogate for managing patients with OIC. Further research is needed to determine a threshold for change in SBMs that is clinically meaningful in both research and clinical settings. A key limitation was the post hoc nature of the study, which was not powered prospectively to examine these relationships."

Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients with IBS-D.
Methods: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical responders [simultaneously meeting weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (?0% improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (?0% decrease from baseline in number of days/week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools) during ? of first 4 weeks posttreatment] who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free observation phase were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire examined patient responses in 8 domains.
Results: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n = 1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference with activity, body image, and sexual function versus nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment (n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID; ?4-point improvement from baseline) in the overall IBS-QOL score versus nonresponders [n = 561 (52.2%) versus n = 287 (21.0%); p < 0.0001]. Among 636 patients with IBS-D relapse, the MCID in the overall IBS-QOL score was achieved by a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving double-blind rifaximin versus placebo (38.6% versus 29.6%, respectively; p = 0.009).
Conclusions: Open-label and blinded retreatment with a short course (2 weeks) of rifaximin improved IBS-QOL in patients with IBS-D [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01543178]."

Methods: Fifty patients with a diagnosis of chronic constipation according to Rome III criteria were recruited and randomized to an intervention (n = 25) or control group (n = 25). The intervention group received CTM in addition to the lifestyle advice, whereas the control group was given only lifestyle advice for constipation. All assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Constipation Severity Instrument. Secondary outcomes included Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire, Bristol Stool Scale, and 7-day bowel diary.

Results: Compared with the control group, subjects in the intervention group reported significantly greater improvement in total and subscale scores of the Constipation Severity Instrument and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire (P < .05). Based on the results from bowel diaries, the improvements in the number of bowel movements, duration of defecation, stool consistency, and the feeling of incomplete evacuation in the intervention group were also significantly more than the control group (P < .05).
Conclusion: This study showed that CTM and lifestyle advice were superior to reducing symptoms of constipation and quality of life compared with lifestyle advice alone for patients with chronic constipation."
103,Association of low dietary intake of fiber and liquids with constipation: evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,Am J Gastroenterol,Alayne D Markland,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2013.73,"Objectives: Epidemiological studies support an association of self-defined constipation with fiber and physical activity, but not liquid intake. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and associations of dietary fiber and liquid intake to constipation.
Methods: Analyses were based on data from 10,914 adults (??0 years) from the 2005-2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Constipation was defined as hard or lumpy stools (Bristol Stool Scale type 1 or 2) as the ""usual or most common stool type."" Dietary fiber and liquid intake from total moisture content were obtained from dietary recall. Co-variables included: age, race, education, poverty income ratio, body mass index, self-reported general health status, chronic illnesses, and physical activity. Prevalence estimates and prevalence odds ratios (POR) were analyzed in adjusted multivariable models using appropriate sampling weights.
Results: Overall, 9,373 (85.9%) adults (4,787 women and 4,586 men) had complete stool consistency and dietary data. Constipation rates were 10.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.6, 10.9) for women and 4.0% (95% CI: 3.2, 5.0) for men (P<.001). After multivariable adjustment, low liquid consumption remained a predictor of constipation among women (POR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6) and men (POR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.9); however, dietary fiber was not a predictor. Among women, African-American race/ethnicity (POR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.9), being obese (POR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5,0.9), and having a higher education level (POR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 0.9) were significantly associated with constipation.
Conclusions: The findings support clinical recommendations to treat constipation with increased liquid, but not fiber or exercise."
104,"Lubiprostone vs Senna in postoperative orthopedic surgery patients with opioid-induced constipation: a double-blind, active-comparator trial",World J Gastroenterol,Christina M Marciniak,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i43.16323,"Aim: To investigate the efficacy of lubiprostone compared to Senna on bowel symptoms and constipation in post-operative orthopedic patients treated with opioids.
Methods: In this double blind, randomized, active comparator trial, adults who required opioids for analgesia following orthopedic procedures and who were admitted in inpatient rehabilitation were randomized following baseline assessments to lubiprostone (Amitza(®)), orally twice a day or Senna (generic) two capsules administered daily for six days. Subjects were assessed using the patient assessment of constipation (PAC)-symptoms (PAC-SYM) and the PAC-quality of life (PAC-QOL) scales measured at baseline and Day 7; Subjects were assessed daily for secondary measures included the Bristol stool scale bowel consistency, specific bowel symptom score (Nausea, cramping, straining, completeness, abdominal pain, time per lavatory attempt, assistance needed), adverse events and rescue medications required. Function was measured using the functional independence measure (FIM) at admission and discharge; length of stay (LOS) and missed treatments due to gastrointestinal symptoms were also assessed.
Results: 64 adults were enrolled; 56 participants (28 in each group) had baseline and follow up measures and were included in the intention to treat (ITT) analyses. 43 participants completed the study, 21 in the active lubiprostone and 22 in the active Senna group. The mean age of the participants was 71.5 years (SD = 11.4 years, range: 28-96 years). In the ITT analyses, participants showed significant improvement in bowel symptoms as measured by the PAC-SYM (mean ± SD, -0.28 ± 0.60, range: -1-2.33) and PAC-QOL (mean ± SD, 0.33 ± 0.81, range: -1.5-2.0) over time, but there were no significant differences between the lubiprostone and Senna groups in mean change in the PAC-SYM (-0.20 ± 0.60 vs -0.36 ± 0.61, P = 0.61 respectively) or the PAC-QOL (0.29 ± 0.76 vs 0.37 ± 0.87, P = 0.61 respectively). The mean change in each bowel symptom also did not significantly differ between treatment groups on ITT analyses, except for completeness of bowel movement, with the Senna group showing greater negative mean change in bowel movement completeness (-0.56 ± 1.01 vs -2.00 ± 1.41, P = 0.03) and for reduction of abdominal pain, favoring Senna (-0.14 ± 0.73 vs -0.73 ± 1.08, P = 0.04). Fifteen (75%) participants in the lubiprostone and in the Senna group requested rescue treatments. Participants made significant functional improvement from admission to discharge over a median LOS of 12 d, with a mean FIM change of 29.13 ± 13.58 and no significant between group differences (27.0 ± 9.2 vs 31.5 ± 16.6, P = 0.27).
Conclusion: Both lubiprostone and Senna improved constipation-related symptoms and QOL in opioid-induced constipation, with no significant between-group differences."
105,"A Phase 1 Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Single Oral Doses of DS-3801b, a Motilin Receptor Agonist, in Healthy Subjects",J Clin Pharmacol,Justin Dennie,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.919,"DS-3801b is an orally active, nonmacrolide, selective motilin receptor agonist. The aim of this 2-part first-in-human study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects on proximal and distal gastrointestinal (GI) motility of single oral doses of DS-3801b in healthy subjects. The 13 C-octanoate breath test was used to assess gastric emptying (GE), a measure of proximal GI motility. The time to first bowel movement (TTFBM) and the consistency of the first bowel movement according to the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) were recorded to assess distal GI motility. In part A, 48 subjects received single oral doses of DS-3801b from 1 to 100 mg or placebo (6 DS-3801b, 2 placebo per cohort). In part B, 12 subjects received 50 mg of DS-3801b or placebo to assess GE. DS-3801b is safe and generally well tolerated after doses up to 50 mg, resulting in mild, predominantly GI adverse events. DS-3801a plasma concentrations increase with increasing doses; however, Cmax increases greater than dose-proportionally, whereas AUC increases less than dose-proportionally. The double peaks observed are consistent with multiple absorption sites. Results of the 13 C-octanoate breath test indicate that DS-3801b accelerates GE. Fifty milligrams of DS-3801b resulted in a 20.8% median reduction in GE T1/2 and a 20.6% median reduction in GE Tlag compared with placebo. However, this increase in proximal GI motility was not accompanied by an effect on distal GI motility, as indicated by no significant differences in TTFBM and BSS values across DS-3801b dose levels or compared with placebo."
106,Is Bifidobacterium breve effective in the treatment of childhood constipation? Results from a pilot study,Nutr J,M M Tabbers,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-10-19,"Background: Probiotics are increasingly used in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Studies in constipated adults with a Bifidus yoghurt (containing Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus) showed a significant increase in defecation frequency. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if Bifidobacterium breve is effective in the treatment of childhood constipation.
Methods: Children, 3 to 16 years of age, with functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria were eligible for this study. During 4 weeks, children received one sachet of powder daily, containing 108- 1010 CFU Bifidobacterium breve. Furthermore, children were instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal and to complete a standardized bowel diary daily. The primary outcome measure was change in defecation frequency. Secondary outcome measures were stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale frequency of episodes of faecal incontinence, pain during defecation, frequency of abdominal pain, frequency of adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea and bad taste), and frequency of intake of bisacodyl.
Results: Twenty children (75% male, mean age 7.4) were included in this pilot study. The defecation frequency per week significantly increased from 0.9 (0-2) at baseline to 4.9 (0-21) in week 4 (p < 0.01). The mean stool consistency score increased from 2.6 (2-4) at baseline to 3.5 (1-6) in week 4 (p = 0.03). The number of faecal incontinence episodes per week significantly decreased from 9.0 (0-35) at baseline to 1.5 (0-7) in week 4 (p < 0.01). Abdominal pain episodes per week significantly decreased from 4.2 (0-7) at baseline to 1.9 (0-7) in week 4 (p = 0.01). No side effects occurred.
Conclusion: Bifidobacterium breve is effective in increasing stool frequency in children with functional constipation. Furthermore it has a positive effect with respect to stool consistency, decreasing the number of faecal incontinence episodes and in diminishing abdominal pain. A randomized placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data."
107,Influence of Bowel Habit and Hormonal Changes on the Development of Hemorrhoidal Disease During Pregnancy and the Postdelivery Period: A Prospective Cohort Study,Dis Colon Rectum,David Parés,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000001822,"Background: Hemorrhoidal disease in women during pregnancy is common in clinical practice. However, prospective data on its real prevalence and women's demographics are scarce.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease during pregnancy and to assess its impact on quality of life. In addition, this study aimed to identify the relationship between patients' characteristics, bowel habits, hormonal changes, and the presence of symptomatic hemorrhoids.
Design: This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study.
Setting: This study was conducted in the Obstetrics Department for pregnancy follow-up.
Patients: The patients evaluated were a cohort of pregnant women.
Intervention: The study was designed to follow a homogeneous cohort of women for 15 months. Visits took place in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, and 3 and 6 months after delivery. Women's demographics (age, medical history, bowel habit, Bristol stool scale) and serum determination of pregnancy-related hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin) were determined.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the development of hemorrhoidal disease.
Results: Overall, 109 women (mean age, 31.2 ± 5.4 years) were included in the study. The prevalence of symptoms and physical findings of hemorrhoidal disease was present in 11% in the first trimester, 23% in the third trimester, 36.2% at 1 month after delivery, and 16.9% at 3 months after delivery. A medical history of hemorrhoidal disease was significantly associated with the diagnosis of hemorrhoids in the first trimester (p < 0.0001) and third trimester (p = 0.005). Symptoms of constipation were associated with this clinical disorder in the first trimester (p = 0.011) and the third trimester of pregnancy (p = 0.022). No association was found between hormonal changes and the development of hemorrhoidal disease.
Limitations: A larger sample would provide more information.
Conclusions: The prevalence of women with hemorrhoidal disease increases during pregnancy and after delivery. A history of hemorrhoidal disease and constipation is significantly associated with the diagnosis of symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B504.

108,Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in pediatric bladder and bowel dysfunction,J Pediatr Urol,Rebecca Wang,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2021.03.032,"Background: Bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) is a common pediatric problem that describes a constellation of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with constipation and/or encopresis. Its association with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric (NDP) problems is not well understood.
Objectives: Our primary aim was to identify pre-existing NDP disorders in children with BBD. Secondarily, we aimed to screen for new behavioral problems and evaluate the association between bladder or bowel symptoms and behaviors symptoms.
Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in urology clinics. New patients referred for BBD between 4 and 17 years old were recruited and completed: a demographics survey, Dysfunctional Voiding Score System questionnaire, assessment of bowel movements with the Bristol Stool Scale, and Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Those with known spinal dysraphism were excluded. SDQ scores were evaluated for abnormal screens in different subscales and total difficulties scores. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted for association.
Results: We included 61 participants (age 9.5 ± 4.1 years), including 33 females and 28 males. One or more pre-existing NDP disorder(s) was reported in 14 (23%) children; most commonly being learning disability (43%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (29%). This cohort had more severe BBD symptoms as reflected in DVSS scores. SDQ scores demonstrated that 12 patients without pre-existing NDP diagnoses scored in the clinical range, with hyperactivity as the most common difficulty (6/12; 50%).
Conclusions: A significant proportion of children with BBD have a comorbid NDP disorder and present with more severe symptomatology. The SDQ can be used as a behavioral screening tool this population for the identification of children who may benefit from formal developmental pediatrics assessment."
109,Designing the GALAXY study: Partnering with the cystic fibrosis community to optimize assessment of gastrointestinal symptoms,J Cyst Fibros,A Jay Freeman,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.12.021,"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement among persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) is highly prevalent, representing a significant source of morbidity. Persons with CF have identified GI concerns as a top research priority, yet universal clinical outcome measures capturing many of the GI symptoms experienced in CF are lacking. The GALAXY study was envisioned to address this unmet need.
Methods: The GALAXY study team partnered with Community Voice, a community of patients with CF and their caregivers, to identify the patient reported outcome measures that most accurately reflected their experience with GI symptoms in CF. We also surveyed CF care teams to identify the comfort level of various team members (providers, nurses and dieticians) in managing a variety of GI conditions.
Results: Members of Community Voice identified the combination of PAC-SYM, PAGI-SYM, PAC-QOL and the Bristol Stool scale with three additional symptom-specific questions as patient-reported outcome measures that comprehensively captured the CF experience with GI disease. CF care team providers reported a high level of comfort in treating GI conditions including constipation (92%), GERD (93%), and gassiness (77%), however comfort level was limited to only first-line interventions.
Conclusion: By partnering with persons with CF as well as their caregivers and medical providers, the GALAXY study is designed to uniquely capture the prevalence and severity of GI involvement among persons with CF in a manner that reflects the CF patient experience. The results of GALAXY will inform the development of future interventional trials and serve as a reproducible and objective study endpoint."
110,"Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Methylnaltrexone in Patients with Opioid-Induced Constipation and Chronic Noncancer Pain: A Phase 3, Open-Label Trial",Pain Med,Lynn R Webster,https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnx148,"Objective: Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist, alleviates opioid-induced constipation. Understanding its long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with chronic noncancer pain is warranted given the persistence of opioid-induced constipation.
Methods.?? In this phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with chronic noncancer pain (N = 1034) received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 12 mg once daily for 48 weeks.
Results: The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal related (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea) and were mild to moderate in intensity. Only 15.2% of patients discontinued because of an adverse event. Serious cardiac-related adverse events occurred in nine patients. Of the seven instances of major adverse coronary events reported, three were adjudicated after external review; all instances occurred in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Methylnaltrexone elicited a bowel movement within four hours in 34.1% of the injections throughout the 48-week treatment period.
Conclusions: Change from baseline in mean weekly bowel movement rate, Bowel Movement Straining Scale score, Bristol Stool Scale score, and mean percentage of patients with complete evacuation from baseline to week 48 were significantly improved ( P < 0.001 for all). Long-term subcutaneous methylnaltrexone was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns, and provided consistent opioid-induced constipation relief in patients with chronic noncancer pain."
111,Polar vectors as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of irritable bowel syndrome treatments: an analysis with pinaverium bromide 100mg plus simethicone 300mg po bid,Rev Gastroenterol Mex,J C L?pez-Alvarenga,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rgmx.2012.10.003,"Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with changes in bowel habit. Currently there are no objective outcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for this disorder.
Aims: To determine the usefulness of a method of analysis that employs polar vectors to evaluate the effectiveness of IBS treatments.
Methods: Data from a Phase IV clinical study with 1677 active IBS-Rome III patients who received 100mg of pinaverium bromide+300mg of simethicone (PB+S) po bid for a period of four weeks were used for the analysis. Using the Bristol Stool Scale as a reference, the consistency and frequency of each type of bowel movement were recorded weekly in a Bristol Matrix (BM) and the data were expressed as polar vectors.
Results: The analysis showed a differential response to the PB+S treatment among the IBS subtypes: in reference to the IBS with constipation subtype, the magnitude of the vector increased from 10.2 to 12.5, reaching maximum improvement at two weeks of treatment (p<0.05, Scheffé). In the IBS with diarrhea and mixed IBS subtypes, the magnitude of the vector decreased from 19 to 14 (p<0.05) and from 16.5 to 13 (p<0.05), respectively, with continuous improvement for a period of four weeks. There was no definable vectorial pattern in the unsubtyped IBS group.
Conclusions: Analysis with polar vectors enables treatment response to be measured in different IBS subtypes. All the groups showed improvement with PB+S, but each one had its own characteristic response in relation to vector magnitude and direction. The proposed method can be implemented in clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of IBS treatments."
112,Addition of probiotics to antibiotics improves the clinical course of pneumonia in young people without comorbidities: a randomized controlled trial,Sci Rep,Chang Hun Lee,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79630-2,"This study was aimed at investigating the clinical efficacy of probiotics in pneumonia patients. To this end, we enrolled 80 participants diagnosed with pneumonia at Naval Pohang Hospital, Pohang, Korea, from May 2016 to January 2017. The participants were randomly assigned to the control and probiotic groups depending on whether they received probiotics. All participants clinically improved but 22.6% of the participants complained of abnormal stool habits after pneumonia treatment. In comparison, fever duration was significantly shorter in the probiotic group, and the group exhibited an improved general condition. The probiotic group also showed better stool characteristics according to the Bristol stool scale (P = 0.009). Notably, the serum hs-CRP levels were significantly lower in the probiotic group at 2 weeks of treatment (P = 0.015), and all participants in the probiotic group achieved their levels within the normal range. Flow cytometry was used to analyze T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs were promoted and the Th17 cell/Treg ratio was suppressed after 2 weeks of treatment in the probiotic group (P = 0.007 and 0.037, respectively). This study demonstrated that probiotics improved clinical symptoms and normalized inflammatory biomarker levels in patients with pneumonia. Early infection and inflammation recovery may be due to the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics by facilitating the subset of Tregs and suppressing the Th17 cell/Treg ratio."
113,Opioid-induced constipation in patients with cancer pain in Japan (OIC-J study): a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with lung cancer,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Hisao Imai,https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyaa186,"Objective: To evaluate the opioid-induced constipation burden in the subgroup of patients with lung cancer who participated in the observational Opioid-Induced Constipation in Patients with Cancer Pain in Japan (OIC-J) study.
Methods: The prospective, observational study, OIC-J, included 212 patients with various tumour types, 33% of whom had lung cancer. The incidence of opioid-induced constipation was evaluated using several diagnostic criteria, as well as the physician's diagnosis and patient's subjective assessment. Following initiation of opioids, patients recorded details of bowel movements (i.e. date/time, Bristol Stool Scale form, sensations of incomplete evacuation or anorectal obstruction/blockage and degree of straining) in a diary for 2 weeks. Relationships between patient characteristics and opioid-induced constipation onset and effects of opioid-induced constipation on quality of life were explored.
Results: In total, 69 patients were included in this post hoc analysis. The incidence of opioid-induced constipation varied (39.1-59.1%) depending on which diagnostic criteria was used. Diagnostic criteria that included a quality component or a patient's feeling of bowel movement as an evaluation item (i.e. Rome IV, physician's diagnosis, Bowel Function Index, patient's assessment) showed higher incidences of opioid-induced constipation than recording the number of spontaneous bowel movements alone. Opioid-induced constipation occurred rapidly after initiating opioids and had a significant impact on Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms total score (P = 0.0031). Patient baseline characteristics did not appear to be predictive of opioid-induced constipation onset.
Conclusions: In patients with lung cancer, opioid-induced constipation can occur quickly after initiating opioids and can negatively impact quality of life. Early management of opioid-induced constipation, with a focus on quality-of-life improvement and patient's assessments of bowel movements, is important for these patients."
114,Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in long-term follow-up after curative gastric resection with D2 lymphadenectomy: A cross-sectional study,Pancreatology,Ali Surmelioglu,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pan.2021.03.019,"Background: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) can be a problem following gastrectomies. This study aimed to reveal the EPI prevalence and its possible causes in gastric cancer patients that underwent subtotal or total gastrectomy, with completed oncological treatments, and with long-term disease-free survival success. Additionally, we also sought to determine whether there were any relations between EPI and blood biomarkers, weight change, malnutrition parameters, and quality of life after gastrectomy.
Methods: A total of 69 gastric cancer patients whose oncological treatments had already been completed, with a minimum follow-up period of 16 months, were included in the study. Fecal samples were taken from all patients for the Fecal Elastase-1 Test, and patients were stratified into three groups based on the results: low (<100 μg/g), moderate (100-200 μg/g), and normal (>200 μg/g). These results were compared with patients' clinical characteristics, blood nutrition biomarkers, Maastricht indexes (MI), Bristol stool scale, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) scores.
Results: FE-1 levels were low in 33 (47.8%) of the patients, moderate in 11 (15.9%), and normal in 25 (36.2%). The rate of patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the low FE-1 group was higher than the normal FE-1 and moderate FE-1 groups (P < 0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum total protein and lipase levels were lower in the low FE-1 group than in the normal FE-1 group (P = 0.023 and P < 0.001, respectively). When compared to the normal FE-1 group, the MI score of the low FE-1 group was higher (P = 0.018). The low FE-1 group had lower GIQLI gastrointestinal symptom scores than the normal FE-1 group (P = 0.046).
Conclusions: During long-term follow-up, EPI can be seen in more than half of patients with gastric cancer after curative gastrectomy. Radiotherapy as an adjunct to adjuvant treatment in the postoperative period is considered a serious risk factor for EPI development. EPI contributes to malnutrition development after gastrectomy and negatively affects the patients' quality of life, especially in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms."
115,Gut Microbiome Changes with Osteopathic Treatment of Constipation in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study,Neurology (ECronicon),Jayme D Mancini,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc8061899/,"Introduction: The gut microbiome appears to be predictive of Parkinson's disease (PD) with constipation. Chronic constipation frequently manifests prior to motor symptoms and impairs quality of life. An osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) sequence used physical exam assessment and manual treatment of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions pertinent to constipation in PD for this prospective ABA-design study, IRB-NYITBHS1065. The effects of 4 weekly treatments on the gut microbiome among men and women over 40 years old with chronic constipation and PD were investigated. Severity of PD was rated with the Movement Disorders Society-Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) in six subjects with constipation. Also, the Bristol stool scale and questionnaires validated for constipation were administered for diagnosis, symptom severity, and quality of life during a 4-week control-period (A), 4-weekly OMM-treatments (B), and 2-weeks no-intervention (A). Biweekly stool samples were assessed for normalized microbiota abundance.
Results: The mean Bristol rating improved from type 2 (± 1) Pre-OMM to 3 (± 1; p = .167; d = 0.677) Post-OMM. Mean constipation severity significantly decreased (p = .010; d = 1.508) Post-OMM. Mean quality of life significantly improved (p = .041; d = 1.072) Post-OMM. The Pre-OMM mean number of families within the phylum Firmicutes decreased by 3 (p = .043; d = 1.177) Post-OMM. There were significant changes in the normalized abundance of phyla Actinobacteria (p = .040; d = 0.845) and Verrucomicrobia (p = .024; d = 0.675) as well as in genus Roseburia (p = .033; d = 1.109), Intestinimonas (p = .035; d = 0.627) and Anaerotruncus (p = .004) Post-OMM.
Conclusion: The gut microbiome shifted among individuals with constipation and PD after four weekly treatments with the OMM-sequence. Changes in the gut microbiome Post-OMM were associated with UPDRS results and constipation measures. Clinical trials and studies to develop the gut microbiome into a validated biomarker for PD are necessary to understand the impact of OMM in patients with PD and constipation."
116,The effects of ingestion of hydrogen-dissolved alkaline electrolyzed water on stool consistency and gut microbiota: a double-blind randomized trial,Med Gas Res,Yoshinori Tanaka,https://doi.org/10.4103/2045-9912.318858,"A relationship between Bifidobacterium and defecation has previously been reported. Our hypothesis on the effectiveness of alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW) proposes that ingestion of AEW, considered possessing antioxidative properties, increases the number of Bifidobacteria and improves stool hardness and gastrointestinal symptoms. A double-blind, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the connection between stool consistency and change in gut microbiota composition induced by drinking hydrogen-dissolved AEW. The participants drank 500 mL of purified tap water or AEW every day for 2 weeks. In this study, drinking AEW did not drastically change gut microbiota, but it appeared to act on a specific bacterial species. Drinking AEW was confirmed to cause an increase in Bifidobacterium. The AEW group also saw stool consistency significantly converge to Bristol stool scale Type 4 (""normal""). Therefore, it is highly likely that the gut microbiota will be changed by drinking AEW. This study was retrospectively registered in University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN ID: UMIN000039507) on February 18, 2020, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Yamanashi (approval No. H30-25) on January 9, 2018."
